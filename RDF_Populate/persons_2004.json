    "miniBio": "Lena Headey is a British actress, she was born in Bermuda, to parents from Yorkshire, England, where she was also raised. She is the daughter of Sue and John Headey, a police officer. Headey is best known for her appearances in The Brothers Grimm (2005), Possession (2002), and The Remains of the Day (1993). Headey stars as Queen Gorgo, a heroic Spartan woman in the period film 300 (2006), by director Zack Snyder. She was born in Bermuda, where her father, a Yorkshire police cadet, was sent shortly before her birth. She was raised in Bermuda, living on the ocean until she was 5. Back in England, she was brought up in Yorkshire before moving to London in her teens. Headey had not gone to drama school before she became an actress. At the age of 17, Headey\u0027s performance in a one-off show in the company of six school friends caught the attention of a casting agent, who took a photo and asked her to audition. Eventually, Headey was cast in Waterland (1992), which became her big-screen debut. She honed her natural acting talent while filming and also took archery classes and horse training. She also took boxing classes in clubs in south London, where a former boxer had been teaching her to spar. During her film career, spanning over 15 years, Headey has shown her range in a variety of roles, playing characters from Amazon-type warriors and action-minded women in The Cave (2005) and The Brothers Grimm (2005), to a lesbian florist in Imagine Me \u0026 You (2005). Headey\u0027s film career has taken her all over the world. She was in India for the filming of A Lenda do Livro da Selva (1994), then in St. Petersburg, Russia, for filming Onegin (1999), and in Norway for filming of Aberdeen (2000). In 2005 Headey was filming in Romania and in Mexico, then spent four months in Prague, Czech Republic, where a forest was designed and built for filming The Brothers Grimm (2005), with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. During 2006 Headey was in Canada for the filming of 300 (2006), then went to locations in Bulgaria for shooting O Contratado (2007), and Germany and in Czech Republic for the filming of O Barão Vermelho (2008). She also played Gina McVey in the horror thriller The Brøken (2008), and Elizabeth in Tell Tale (2009). In addition to her film-work, Heady appeared as Sarah Connor in a TV spin-off of the popular \"Terminator\" film franchise, the FOX\u0027s television series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008). Outside of her acting profession, Headey continued taking boxing lessons in London. She is a vegetarian and also remains loyal to yoga, which she discovered during her work in India. She has never been back to her birthplace in Bermuda; she shares her time between her homes in London, England, and Los Angeles, California.",

She came to the U.S. to attend college in 1981, first at the State University of New York at New Paltz, later at California State University at Northridge. She a succession of small parts in movies and T.V., with her first break coming in 1986 when, in true Hollywood legend, producer Dino De Laurentiis noticed her in the parking lot of Lorimar Studios and cast her in Tai-Pan (1986). The film bombed, but it led to her being cast as the ill-fated Empress in Bernardo Bertolucci\u0027s O Último Imperador (1987), which won critical acclaim. This, and her role as enigmatic mill owner Josie Packard in the cult TV series Twin Peaks (1990), are her best-known roles in Europe and North America. However, Hollywood\u0027s practice of type-casting East Asians has led to a dearth of major roles for Chen since then, and in recent roles, she has often been cast as a villainess. After taking a few years off to start a family, Joan returned to the screen in important supporting roles playing women in early middle age, such as the mother of a principle adult character. As a result, her career is flourishing again on both sides of the Pacific. Her two directing efforts were well-received critically, and in a 2008 interview she revealed she planned to direct again but was putting that off until her daughters were grown, since directing took her away from them too much, whereas acting could be done on a part-time basis.",

His father was stationed in Colwyn Bay during WWII, and moved the family to Manchester in the late 1940s, where he worked in advertising and raised the growing Dalton family, in an upper-class neighborhood outside of Belper, Derbyshire. Timothy was enrolled in a school for bright children, where he excelled in sports and was interested in the sciences. He was fascinated with acting from a young age, perhaps due to the fact that both his grandfathers were vaudevillians, but it was when he saw a performance of \"Macbeth\" at age 16 that his destiny was clinched. After leaving Herbert Strutt Grammar School at the age of sixteen, he toured as a leading member of Michael Croft\u0027s National Youth Theater. Between 1964-66, he studied at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Just before completing his two years, he quit and joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre, playing the lead in many productions under the direction of Peter Dews while at the same time turning professional. Dalton later said of RADA in an interview with \"Seventeen\" Magazine (December 1970), \"It took a year to undo the psychological damage that was caused by the oppressive teachers\". His talent and classic good looks immediately landed him professional work in television, guest-starring on an episode of the short-lived TV series, Judge Dee (1969), and as a regular on the 14-episode series Sat\u0027day While Sunday (1967) with the young Malcolm McDowell. In late 1967 Peter O\u0027Toole recommended him for the role of the young \"King Philip of France\" in The Lion in Winter (1968) (coincidentally, this was also Anthony Hopkins\u0027 big break). The following year, he starred in the Italian film The Voyeur (1970) with Marcello Mastroianni and Virna Lisi, although his voice was dubbed into Italian by another actor. Dalton also mixed in a healthy dose of BBC work during this time, including The Three Princes (1968), _BBC Play of the Month: Five Finger Exercise (1970) (TV)_ and Candida (1973). Also during this time, he was approached and tested for the role of \"James Bond\" in On Her Majesty\u0027s Secret Service (1969) but turned it down, feeling he was too young for the part. His next film was another costume drama, Cromwell (1970), working with director Ken Hughes, with whom he later made his first American film, Sextette (1978). He followed Cromwell (1970) with Wuthering Heights (1970) and Mary, Queen of Scots (1971). He was already developing a pattern in his films that would follow him throughout his career: costume dramas where he played royalty, which he had done in three of his first four films (and ridden horses in three, and raised a sword in two). In 1972, he was contracted to play a part in Lady Caroline Lamb (1972). However, at the last moment he was replaced. Dalton sued the company and won, but the film went on without him. From the early to mid-1970s, he decided to further hone his skills by going back into the theater full time. He signed on with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) and the Prospect Theatre Company (PTC), and toured the world with both, playing the leads in \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"King Lear\", \"Henry V\", \"Love\u0027s Labours Lost\", and \"Henry IV\" - parts 1 and 2. In 1975, he returned to movies in the British/Austrian production of The Executioner (1975). It was followed in 1976 by the Spanish religious historical film about the inquisition, The Man Who Knew Love (1978), which was never widely released. After this, he took another break from film, mixing in a healthy dose of theater, returning for his first American film, Sextette (1978), and the lengthy miniseries Centennial (1978), his first American television appearance, in which Lynn Redgrave played his wife. Because of his broad exposure to American audiences in this series, he began to get more frequent film and television work in the US, including the episode \"Fallen Angel\" of Charlie\u0027s Angels (1976) -- which, ironically, had several references to his character being like \"James Bond\" -- and the TV movie The Flame Is Love (1979). Although he did a few features, including playing Vanessa Redgrave\u0027s husband in Agatha (1979), most of his work until 1985 consisted of TV movies and miniseries. He played royalty again in the very campy Flash Gordon (1980). He followed this with a small film, Chanel Solitaire (1981) and, in 1981, also filmed a staged production of Antony and Cleopatra (1983) opposite Lynn Redgrave, with Anthony Geary, as well as Nichelle Nichols and Walter Koenig of the original TV series, Star Trek (1966). The years 1983-1987 have so far been the most prolific of his career. In 1983, he starred as \"Rochester\" in what he considers one of his best works, the BBC\u0027s very popular Jane Eyre (1983). Also, during this time, Roger Moore was considering leaving Bond, and Dalton was again approached, but due to his full schedule, he had to decline. In 1984, he did one of his many narrations in the Faerie Tale Theatre (1982) production of The Emperor\u0027s New Clothes (1987). That same year also saw him in the Hallmark Hall of Fame piece The Master of Ballantrae (1984) opposite Michael York and Richard Thomas, and another miniseries, Mistral\u0027s Daughter (1984), opposite Stefanie Powers and Stacy Keach. The next year was also a very busy one. He starred in another miniseries, Sins (1986), playing the brother of Joan Collins, and also starred in and narrated the four-hour TV movie Florence Nightingale (1985), opposite Jaclyn Smith. He also starred in The Doctor and the Devils (1985) as \"Dr. Thomas Rock\", with Stephen Rea, Jonathan Pryce, and Patrick Stewart. In the mid-to-late 1980s, Dalton narrated many nature documentaries, most notably several episodes of the UK series Wildlife Chronicles (1987) (called \"Wildlife Chronicles\" in the US). In the spring of 1986, he teamed with Vanessa Redgrave for another revival of a Shakespeare production, The Taming of the Shrew (1988) and his interpretation of \"Petrucchio\" received uniformly high praise. Simultaneously, the world was playing a guessing game as to who would succeed Roger Moore as \"James Bond\". Dalton was approached but was committed to the theater, and so Pierce Brosnan was offered the part. When Brosnan was unable to get out of his Remington Steele (1982) contract at the last minute, Dalton was again approached. Able now to work it into his tight schedule, he agreed. Although his first outing as Bond, The Living Daylights (1987), did reasonably well at the box-office, Licence to Kill (1989) suffered from a lack of marketing that appeared to harm its chances of big box-office success. However, Dalton\u0027s interpretation of \"Bond\" in this film received critical acclaim in some quarters as being the closest to author Ian Fleming\u0027s literary \"Bond\". Back in the theater, he teamed again with Vanessa Redgrave for a revival of Eugene O\u0027Neill\u0027s seldom performed play, \"A Touch of the Poet\", which is considered by some to be his and Redgrave\u0027s finest professional collaboration. Although there were talks of bringing the play to Broadway, this never materialized. Following Licence to Kill (1989), he immediately returned to one of his strengths, costume drama, in The King\u0027s Whore (1990). It was followed by his excellent performance in Disney\u0027s The Rocketeer (1991), where he played a swashbuckling, Errol Flynn type. In August 1991, he teamed with Whoopi Goldberg for the first bi-racial interpretation of \"Love Letters\" for the final sold-out performances of the play in Los Angeles. When he had signed on to do \"Bond\" it was for three pictures, but the rights to the \"Bond\" films became entangled in lengthy litigation, delaying production of the third. During this wait, he was set to star in the title role of another historical epic, Christopher Columbus: The Discovery (1992). From the start, however, the film was doomed due to the competition with the Gérard Depardieu \"Columbus\" picture, which was racked with its own problems. When the director was replaced, Dalton backed out and was followed by his co-star, Isabella Rossellini. In 1992, he starred in the A\u0026E production Framed (1992), which won a bronze medal in the 1993 New York Film Festival. The next year, he journeyed to northern Alaska and Minnesota to make a documentary on one of his favorite subjects, wolves. In the Company of Whales (1991) went on to win a silver medal in the 1994 New York Film Festival. He kept busy in television through 1993 and 1994. He made Lie Down with Lions (1994), Scarlett (1994) and managed to squeeze in a guest appearance on Tales from the Crypt (1989) in the episode \"Werewolf Concerto\". In 1994, he took on the role of \"Rhett Butler\" in the eight-hour mini-series Scarlett (1994), produced by Robert Halmi Sr. for the Hallmark Hall of Fame. In April of that year, believing he needed to move on to fresh challenges, he officially resigned the role of \"James Bond\", a move which was much regretted by the producers, though they understood his reasons. After two months of negotiations, the role went to Pierce Brosnan. In September 1994, Dalton was called upon for two readings of \"Peter and the Wolf\" at the Hollywood Bowl. He played to full-capacity crowds. In November, Scarlett (1994) premiered and, though given only a lukewarm response by critics, it was a ratings success not only in the US but all over the world, breaking records in many European countries. As always after a major work, Dalton again withdrew quietly and without fanfare to search for his next project, a small, personal film. In the summer of 1995, he journeyed to Canada to shoot Salt Water Moose (1996). The film was made by Canada\u0027s Norstar Entertainment and was sold to Halmi to be the first video release in his new line of Hallmark family films. It premiered on Showtime in June 1996. During the spring of 1996, he made the IRA drama O Informante (1997) in Ireland and, in May, he traveled to Prague to shoot Passion\u0027s Way (1999), opposite Sela Ward. On February 7, 1997, the comedy The Beautician and the Beast (1997) co-starring Fran Drescher opened in the US. He also gleefully parodied his swashbuckling/James Bond image in Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003) as a spy playing an actor playing a spy. In 1995, Dalton began a relationship with Oksana Grigorieva which produced a child in 1997, Dalton\u0027s son Alexander. Over the following years, Dalton has been a caring and loving father of his son. Very much a private man, Dalton\u0027s pastimes include fishing, reading, jazz, opera, antique fairs and auctions and, of course, movies.",

    "miniBio": "Eva Gaëlle Green was born on July 5, 1980, in Paris, France. She has a sororal twin sister. Her father, Walter Green, is a dentist who appeared in the 1966 film Au Hasard Balthazar (1966). Her mother, Marlène Jobert, is an actress turned children\u0027s book writer. Eva\u0027s mother was born in Algeria, of Sephardi Jewish heritage (during that time, Algeria was part of France), and Eva\u0027s father is of Swedish and French descent. Eva left French school at 17. She switched to English in Ramsgate, Kent, and went to the American School in France for one year. She studied acting at Saint Paul Drama School in Paris for three years, then had a 10-week polishing course at the Weber Douglas Academy of dramatic Art in London. She also studied directing at the Tisch School of Arts at New York University. She returned to Paris as an accomplished young actress, and played on stage in several theater productions: \"La Jalousie en Trois Fax\" and \"Turcaret\". There, she caught the eye of director Bernardo Bertolucci. Green followed a recommendation to work on her English. She studied for two months with an English coach before doing The Dreamers (2003) with Bernardo Bertolucci. During their work, Bertolucci described Green as being \"so beautiful it\u0027s indecent\". Green won critical acclaim for her role in The Dreamers (2003). She also attracted a great deal of attention from male audiences for her full frontal nudity in several scenes of the film. Besides her work as an actress, Green also composed original music and recorded several sound tracks for the film score. After \"The Dreamers\", Green\u0027s career ascended to the level where she revealed more of her multifaceted acting talent. She played the love interest of cult French gentleman stealer, Adventures of Arsene Lupin (2004), opposite Romain Duris. In 2005, she co-starred, opposite Orlando Bloom and Liam Neeson, in Kingdom of Heaven (2005), produced and directed by Ridley Scott. The film brought her a wider international exposure. She turned down the femme fatale role in A Dália Negra (2006), that went to Hilary Swank, because she didn\u0027t want to end up always typecast as a femme fatale after her role in \"The Dreamers\". Instead, Eva Green accepted the prestigious role of \"Vesper Lynd\", one of three Bond girls, opposite Daniel Craig, in Casino Royale (2006) and became the 5th French actress to play a James Bond girl, after Claudine Auger in Thunderball (1965), Corinne Cléry in Moonraker (1979), Carole Bouquet in For Your Eyes Only (1981) and Sophie Marceau in The World Is Not Enough (1999). Since her school years, Green has been a cosmopolitan multilingual and multicultural person. Yet, since her father always lived in France with them and her mother, she and her twin sister can\u0027t speak Swedish. She developed a wide scope of interests beyond her acting profession and became an aspiring art connoisseur and an avid museum visitor. Her other activities, outside of acting, include playing and composing music, cooking at home, walking her terrier, and collecting art. She shares time between her two residencies, one is in Paris, France, and one in London, England.",

    "miniBio": "Katie Cassidy was born Katherine Evelyn Cassidy on November 25, 1986, in Los Angeles, California. Her father, David Cassidy, was a pop star in the 1970s. Her mother, Sherry Williams, was a high fashion model in the early 1970\u0027s. Sherry left her career to concentrate on raising her 3 daughters, with husband, Richard Benedon M.D., Katie\u0027s step-dad. Her famous relatives include uncles Shaun Cassidy, Patrick Cassidy and Ryan Cassidy, and grandparents Jack Cassidy, Evelyn Ward and Shirley Jones. As a child, Katie took gymnastics, studied piano, guitar and singing, then took dancing and acting lessons and eventually became a cheerleader for the California Flyers. She attended Calabasas High School in her neighborhood, where she also cheered as a freshman. Her mother insisted that she complete college prep classes in high school before she embarked on her acting career. For years prior to graduation in 2005, Katie was modeling and studying acting in community theater. Katie had just been accepted to \u0027Tisch\u0027 at NYU when she was offered her first role as \"Dee Dee\", which was one month before graduating. Katie has not stopped working since. Katie\u0027s early exposure to show business, the cosmopolitan culture of Los Angeles, her family upbringing, and her comprehensive education altogether produced a remarkable result. She grew up as a multifaceted person showing her many talents in a variety of professions such as recording her father\u0027s 1970s hit \"I Think I Love You\" and singing in VH1\u0027s TV special Bubblegum Babylon (2002), writing her own songs, modeling for Abercrombie and Fitch and Guess?\u0027s Rock and Republic clothing lines in 2004, and acting. However, she was publicly criticized by her father who would have liked for her to wait before she covered his classic hit. During her stint with Artemis Records, she was introduced to the popular boy band Dream Street. There she met Greg Raposo, who wrote the song \"We\u0027re In Love\" for her when they dated in 2002, She also met her boyfriend, Jesse McCartney, there and later appeared as his love interest in his video hit \"She\u0027s No You\". A story on Jesse and Katie appeared in the January 2006 issue of Teen People magazine. At that time she was busy working on five feature film productions going on almost simultaneously. Katie made several appearances in TV series, such as 7th Heaven (1996) and Sex, Love \u0026 Secrets (2005), among others. She appeared as Samantha, the grown-up daughter of Adam Sandler and Kate Beckinsale in the comedy Click (2006). After the release of a teen horror film, When a Stranger Calls (2006), in which she co-starred as Tiffany, Cassidy went to Vancouver to work on her second horror film, Black Christmas (2006), in which she stars as a sorority girl. Katie recently beat out the likes of Jessica Simpson and Kristin Cavallari for the leading role opposite John Travolta as his daughter and the heir to the most powerful energy company in the world in Dallas, the big-screen remake of the cult TV series.",

    "miniBio": "An extremely gifted and versatile performer adept at both comedy and drama, actress/singer Katey Sagal became a household name in the late 1980s as the fabulously brazen, undomesticated Peg Bundy on the enduring Fox series Married with Children (1987). During its lengthy run, she received three Golden Globe and two American Comedy Award nominations. As popular and identifiable as her Peg Bundy persona was, Katey assertively moved on without a hitch after the show went off the air, not only starring in other sitcoms and television movies, but portraying characters that were polar opposite to the outrageous role that first earned her nationwide attention. For example, In 2008, she took on the role of Gemma Teller Morrow -- the matriarch of a Hell\u0027s Angels-esque California biker gang -- on the series Sons of Anarchy (2008), and in 2011, her portrayal earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama. In addition to her busy on-camera scheduling, Katey has retraced her steps back to her first love: singing and songwriting. With the support of her record label Valley Entertainment, she released the album \"Room\" in 2004, which combined such classics as \"Feel a Whole Lot Better\" and \"(For the Love of) Money\" with original songs she penned, including \"Life Goes Round\", \"Daddy\u0027s Girl\" and \"Wish I Were a Kid\". \"Room\" is her first CD since her 1994 debut \"Well\". Born Catherine Louise Sagal, her father was the late Boris Sagal, the noted television and film director; her mother, Sara Zwilling, was a director and singer. Katey began performing at age 5 and studied voice and acting at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, California. A singing waitress during her \"salad\" years, she first started performing with the band \"The Group with No Name\", and then caught a break after hooking up with Gene Simmons and his 1970s rock band KISS. In the meantime, she gained valuable experience as a backup recording singer for Simmons and such other established stars as Bob Dylan, Olivia Newton-John, Etta James and Tanya Tucker. Katey also was dynamic performing live backup with diva Bette Midler as one of her \"Harlettes\" in Bette\u0027s wildly avant garde stage shows during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1985, while performing on stage in a musical, she was spotted by talent agents who subsequently cast her as Mary Tyler Moore\u0027s feisty co-worker Jo Tucker in Mary (1985), a short-lived comedy series. From that point on she focused on film and television. In 1987, she won the role of Peg Bundy in Married with Children (1987), and the rest is history. In her post-Bundy career, Katey has continued to demonstrate a strong range, playing a much more responsible parent in the popular sitcom 8 Simple Rules (2002). Co-starring the late John Ritter, Katey valiantly moved to single head of household after Ritter\u0027s sudden passing in 2003 with highly successful results. Katey has earned equally fine kudos for her television movies, appearing in such fare as Chance of a Lifetime (1998), a charming romantic comedy that also co-starred John Ritter, God\u0027s New Plan (1999), a tearjerker in which she played a dying mother, and the Disney offerings Smart House (1999) and Mr. Headmistress (1998). The voice of Turanga Leela, the beautiful one-eyed sewer mutant, in the animated series Futurama (1999), she also has guested on such series as Ghost Whisperer (2005), Lost (2004), Boston Legal (2004), CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000) and Eli Stone (2008). Feature films have included Maid to Order (1987), The Good Mother (1988), the Sundance Film Festival favorite Dropping Out (2000), Following Tildy (2002) and the indie I\u0027m Reed Fish (2006). More recently, she played Jack\u0027s mother in a live action/adventure retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk (2010) that also featured the talents of Christopher Lloyd, James Earl Jones and Chevy Chase. Katey resides in the Los Angeles area with husband, writer/producer/director/creator Kurt Sutter, whose acclaimed work includes The Shield (2002) and the offbeat Sons of Anarchy (2008), the latter show created by Sutter with Katey intriguingly cast as a motorcycle club family matriarch. They share their home with three children, Sarah, Jackson and Esmé, and three dogs, Lumpy, Lola and Blue.",

    "miniBio": "An actress on both stage and screen, Anna Gunn has portrayed a vast array of complex and powerful characters throughout her career. Anna grew up in Santa Fe, New Mexico after her parents transplanted the family from Cleveland, Ohio to the Southwest in the late seventies. She discovered acting in a drama class at the Santa Fe Preparatory School and was fortunate to study with two formidable teachers from the Actor\u0027s Studio as a teenager. She continued her education and training at Northwestern University\u0027s renowned theatre department, winning a coveted scholarship award in her junior year. During her time at Northwestern, Anna went abroad for a semester to study with the British American Drama Academy and had the marvelous opportunity to perform in the school\u0027s final project at the famed Royal Court Theatre in London. Anna has moved between television, film, and theatre with much ease. In 2004, Anna landed her breakout television role, playing Martha Bullock on HBO\u0027s seminal show, Deadwood (2004) and later received a SAG nomination for Best Ensemble Cast in 2006. Anna\u0027s association with Deadwood (2004) creator David Milch began early on when she first worked with him on his hit drama NYPD Blue (1993), giving a memorable performance as Kimmy, a junkie longing to escape New York to swim with the dolphins. Anna made such an indelible impression on Milch, that almost nine years later she became the template for the pivotal and complex character of Martha. Another major recurring role for Anna was on David E. Kelley\u0027s The Practice (1997), delivering a notable turn as ADA Jean Ward opposite Dylan McDermott and Lara Flynn Boyle. Her extensive television credits also include starring roles in several made for TV movies and major guest starring appearances on such shows as Six Feet Under (2001), ER (1994), Boston Legal (2004), Law \u0026 Order (1990) and Seinfeld (1989). Highlights of Anna\u0027s feature film work include the dark comedy, Nobody\u0027s Baby (2001), in which she starred with Gary Oldman and Mary Steenburgen; the film premiered at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. In 1998, she played opposite Jon Voight in Tony Scott\u0027s summer blockbuster, Enemy of the State (1998). Her first starring role was in 1995\u0027s independent thriller, Without Evidence (1995), along side Angelina Jolie. Anna was recently in Kevin Smith\u0027s Red State (2011). Her upcoming films include Little Red Wagon (2012) and Sassy Pants (2012), for which she received a nomination at the 2012 Milan Film Festival for Best Supporting Actress. Anna is also a highly regarded and much sought after actress of the stage. In early 2009 she created the leading role of photojournalist Sarah Goodwin in Donald Margulies\u0027 world premiere production of Time Stands Still, directed by Daniel Sullivan at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles. In 1999 she starred as Isabella in Measure for Measure at the Ahmanson Theatre helmed by the famed director Sir Peter Hall. In 1997, Anna was brought east to make her Broadway debut alongside Roger Rees in The Rehearsal at the Roundabout Theater. Before that she played on the LA circuit, including the 1995 American premiere of Hysteria directed by Phyllida Lloyd at the Mark Taper Forum. Before settling in Los Angeles, Anna built an impressive background performing on stage in Chicago. She received exceptional reviews in Uncommon Ground at the Northlight Theatre, and playing opposite Jeremy Piven in Keith Reddin\u0027s Peacekeeper at the American Blues Theatre. She even landed her first professional acting role, playing Lucy Lockit in the critically acclaimed production of The Beggar\u0027s Opera at the Court Theatre while still an undergraduate at Northwestern University. In late 2011, Anna immersed herself in the role of Marie Curie for Alan Alda\u0027s world premiere of Radiance: The Passion of Marie Curie, directed by Daniel Sullivan at the Geffen Playhouse and received rave reviews. She starring as Skyler White on AMC\u0027s Emmy award-winning series Breaking Bad (2008); a role that garnered Anna a 2012 Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series Emmy Nomination until she won in 2013-2014, a 2012 Best Supporting Actress nomination by the Broadcast Television Journalist Association for a Critics\u0027 Choice Television Award, and a 2012 \u0026 2013 Screen Actor\u0027s Guild Award for Best Ensemble Cast. The cast was also the recipient of the 2008 Peabody Award and won an AFI Award both in 2008 and 2011. The show was also nominated in 2013 by the Hollywood Foreign Press Golden Globe\u0027s as Best Television Drama until it won in 2014.",

He has contacted the entire cast to explain what is referred to as \"personal reasons\" for leaving. It seems that although Patinkin was prepared for the show to include violence the actual level of violence portrayed was unacceptable to the actor. He left to do more light hearted work.

    "miniBio": "John Mark Galecki was born in Belgium where his dad was stationed while serving in the U.S. Air Force. When he was 3 years old, his family moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he grew up along with his sister Allison (1980) and brother Nick (1982). His father then became a teacher for blind veterans in a VA hospital outside of Chicago. When Galecki was 16, his father died in an accident. His mom, Mary Lou, recalled in an interview with People magazine that Galecki was a very artistic kid; at only 4 years old, he told her: \"Mom, I\u0027m gonna be on T.V., and I don\u0027t mean when I grow up.\" Two years later, when their attempts to distract him with sports failed, Galecki\u0027s parents took him to open auditions at local theaters in Chicago. He landed his first role in \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" and more parts in other productions followed. By age 11, he was already known as an excellent actor in Chicago\u0027s theater scene evidenced by him receiving a Joseph Jefferson Citation nomination for portraying John Henry in \"The Member of the Wedding.\" In 1989 he was cast in his first movie, a holiday film called Prancer (1989), but his big break was in another Christmas movie as Chevy Chase\u0027s son Rusty Griswold, in Christmas Vacation (1989). On the set, Chase took a liking to him, and Galecki recalled in a later interview that Chevy Chase showed him some tricks for comedic timing. By that time, his whole family had moved from Chicago to L.A. to support his career. But within 10 months they realized they missed Chicago too much, and moved back home. Galecki, still just 14, was under contract on a show with Robert Urich called \"American Dreamer (1990)\", so he stayed in L.A. Although he was living alone in a studio apartment, he never got into trouble and admitted himself that he was a good kid. He recalled living alone in L.A. without adult supervision as \"not fun\" and \"quite intimidating and lonely, to be honest. But I\u0027ve always been happiest when I\u0027m working, so...\" He bought a motorcycle with a mirrored helmet so he could get to work and back, at Paramount studios. In 1991 Galecki was picked by Roseanne Barr to play her son in the made for T.V. movie Backfield in Motion (1991). She liked him so much she asked him to come on her sitcom for what started as a one-off appearance, but soon turned into the important recurring role of David Healy. His family was religious viewers of the show and he was somewhat intimidated at first to be working with his television heroes. However, before long, it was his heroes that praised him: Roseanne said he showed \"great vulnerability.\" John Goodman said: \"If he was one of those little stuffed bears at a carny, he\u0027d have a Wuv me t-shirt on. People just want to take care of him.\" Galecki also became very close friends with co-star Sara Gilbert and the show\u0027s executive producer Eric Gilliland. After Roseanne (1988) he worked on a number of diverse roles, from funny Ira alongside Christopher Walken in the 1997 dark-comedy Suicide Kings (1997) to a drug-addicted student in 2003\u0027s Apostadores (2003), and he played gay characters in Don Roos\u0027s Bounce (2000) and The Opposite of Sex (1998). He never stayed far from the television industry as he made guest appearances such as Laurie Freeman\u0027s younger lover in Norm (1999) (where he once again worked with Laurie Metcalf, his former Roseanne cast mate), as a golfer in My Name Is Earl (2005), as Hope \u0026 Faith (2003)\u0027s younger brother in the sitcom of the same name, and as hilarious party-boy Trouty on My Boys (2006). In 2006 he returned to his theater roots as he took on the role of conflicted but sweet male escort Alex in Douglas Carter Beane\u0027s play \"The Little Dog Laughed,\" for which he received a 2007 Theatre World Award for Outstanding Browdway Debut. In 2007 he was back on the small screens, starring as Leonard Hofstadter in the sitcom The Big Bang Theory (2007). Not only was Chuck Lorre, a former producer for Roseanne, a producer of the new show, but Sara Gilbert and Laurie Metcalf both made guest appearances. Galecki is a self-admitted motorcycle \"nerd,\" and drives a Harley Davidson Softail Deluxe. Although he never went to college, he has said: \"I\u0027m not dead! We should never stop learning. We should never stop absorbing,\" and so he learned how to play the cello in his early twenties. He likes traveling around the world, painting, music (he also plays bass), and hiking with his dog Vera. He always has been very private about his personal life and little is known about past relationships. It has only been confirmed that he dated actresses Laura Harris and Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting. He isn\u0027t on twitter, and Galecki once said, \"I don\u0027t understand the current frame of mind in our society that seems to say that any action is not of value until it\u0027s broadcast somehow.\" He still lives in Los Angeles but is often spotted in Chicago, where his siblings still live.",

    "miniBio": "Jensen Ross Ackles, better known as simply Jensen Ackles, was born on March 1, 1978, in Dallas, Texas, to Donna Joan (Shaffer) and actor Alan Ackles. He has English, German, and Scottish ancestry. Jensen grew up in Richardson, Texas, together with his older brother, Joshua, and a younger sister, Mackenzie. Jensen graduated from Dartmouth Elementary School in 1990, he graduated from Apollo Junior High School in 1993, and LV Berkner High School in 1996. Jensen is a sports junkie. He loves football, lacrosse, baseball and basketball. He even played on the baseball and lacrosse teams in high school. The 6\u0027 1\" actor first started modeling when he was just 2 years old. When he turned 4, he started appearing in TV commercials for Nabisco, RadioShack and Wal-Mart. He caught the acting bug because he was mostly influenced by his father, who was an actor in Dallas. He used to watch his father study scripts, and that taught him a few things about the industry. During his later years in high school, he started taking theater classes, where he claimed he was the only \"jock\" in that department. When he was just a sophomore, a friend of Jensen had asked him to attend a local acting seminar. Two guys, Craig Wargo, and an agent, \u0027Michael Einfeld\u0027, were interested in Jensen\u0027s talent and wanted him to go to Los Angeles with them. Jensen had to say no to the offer and admitted at one point, he thought they would forget about him but, eventually, when he went to Los Angeles, he still managed to get help from them. Prior to that, Jensen actually planned to study sports medicine at Texas Tech University and become a physical therapist, before he decided to move to Los Angeles to give acting a try. In 1996, he managed to secure guest roles on several TV shows, which included Wishbone (1995), Mr. Rhodes (1996), 7th Heaven (1996) and Gémeas (1994). Jensen\u0027s big break came when he was cast in the NBC soap opera, Days of Our Lives (1965), as Eric Brady in 1997. He won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Male Newcomer in 1998, and was nominated three times in 1998, 1999, and 2000 for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series for his work on Days of Our Lives (1965). After spending about three years on a soap set, he left Days of Our Lives (1965) and went on to appear in the mini-series Blonde (2001), which was about the life of Marilyn Monroe, playing Eddie G. He also auditioned for the role of Clark Kent on Smallville (2001), but lost the part to Tom Welling, instead. Not giving up hope, he went for a few auditions and managed to secure a guest role on the popular James Cameron TV series, Dark Angel (2000), as serial killer Ben/X5-493, the brother of main character Max/X5-452, who was played by Jessica Alba. His character died in the episode, but Jensen eventually returned to the show as a regular in the second season as Ben\u0027s clone, Alec/X5-494 and continued on until the show\u0027s cancellation in 2002. In 2003, he joined the cast of Dawson\u0027s Creek (1998), playing the role of C.J., Jen Lindley\u0027s lover. He also filmed episodes of the TV series, Still Life (2003), playing the role of Max Morgan, not knowing that the series was actually dropped. He also had a small role in the short film, The Plight of Clownana (2004), playing the role of Jensen. That same year, he was offered the part of Eliza Dushku\u0027s love interest on the second season of Tru Calling (2003). Jensen, however, turned down the role which was later offered to another actor, Eric Christian Olsen. He was subsequently cast on Smallville (2001), as Assistant football coach Jason Teague, the new love interest of Lana Lang. In 2005, Jensen managed to earn a lead role in the movie, Devour (2005), playing the role of Jake Gray. Jensen also earned the opportunity to work his father, actor Alan Ackles, who happened to play his character\u0027s father, Paul Kilton. The movie, however, received mixed reviews from the public. That same year, Jensen joined the cast of the CW series, Supernatural (2005), where he plays the role of Dean Winchester. Dean and his brother Sam, who is played by Jared Padalecki, are brothers who drive throughout the United States hunting paranormal predators, sometimes with their father, John Winchester, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. It was reported that the creator of the show, Eric Kripke, mentioned that the show will last for a maximum of five seasons. In 2006, Jensen took on a role in the Independently filmed comedy/drama movie, Ten Inch Hero (2007), which explores the theme of honesty and the flaw of judging by appearances. In 2007 the film began a limited run at number of film festivals including the Newport Beach Film Festival, Phoenix Film Festival and the Santa Cruz Film Festival but never made it into major mainstream theatrical release. In the Spring of 2008 Ten Inch Hero was released onto DVD exclusively through Blockbuster. Jensen however, received high praise for his work as Priestly, who one of the movie\u0027s more quirky characters. From June 5-10 in 2007 Jensen had his professional stage debut as Lt. Daniel Kaffee in \"A Few Good Men\" at Casa Manana Theatre in Fort Worth, Texas, working along side Lou Diamond Phillips. This proved to be another successful acting venture for Jensen, as critics were impressed with his work in this role. During his free time, Jensen enjoys golfing, horseback riding, scuba diving and photography. He is also a big fan of country music. His favorite musician is Garth Brooks. He even sang back-up vocals on good friend Steve Carlson\u0027s albums \"Spot in the Corner\" and \"Rollin\u0027 On.\" In the summer of 2008 Jensen traveled to Kittaning, PA to film the horror/thriller movie, My Bloody Valentine (2009), which was filmed in the cutting edge Real D technology, Jensen played the lead role of Tom Hanniger and starred alongside Jaime King and Kerr Smith. Jensen splits his off time between Burbank, California and Vancouver, British Columbia.",

    "miniBio": "Jim Beaver is an American character actor, best known for his leading roles on the TV series Deadwood (2004) and Supernatural (2005). Born in Laramie, Wyoming a minister\u0027s son, he was raised in and around Irving, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. Following high school and a year of college, he joined the Marines and served as a radioman with the 1st Marine Division in Vietnam. He attended Oklahoma Christian College, where he first became interested in acting as a career. After one year, he transferred to Central State University (now the University of Central Oklahoma) and while a student made his professional debut in a production of \"Rain\" at the Oklahoma Theatre Center in 1972. He obtained a degree in theatre and returned to the Dallas area where he worked for five seasons with the Dallas Shakespeare Festival. He had written several plays in college and afterward (as well as a biography of actor John Garfield), and in 1979 he was commissioned for the first of three plays at Actors Theatre of Louisville. He also began to make appearances in bit roles in films and television shows shot in the Dallas area, including Semi-Tough (1977) and Dallas (1978). Moving to New York in 1979, he worked in stock and in dinner theatre tours, and also maintained a side career as a critic, columnist, and feature writer for Films in Review, the magazine of the National Board of Review. An assignment for an article on TV Superman George Reeves led him to Los Angeles. During his research there, his play \"Verdigris\" was produced to solid reviews at Theatre West in Hollywood, and he was signed as a writer by Sam Adams, partner in the prestigious Triad Artists agency. He began a successful period as a television writer, penning episodes for shows such as Vietnam War Story (1987), Tour of Duty (1987), and Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1985), and was nominated for a CableAce Award for an episode of the latter. He had continued to act on stage and in small film and TV roles, and in 1988 he landed a substantial supporting role as Bruce Willis\u0027s best friend, an alcoholic Vietnam veteran, in Norman Jewison\u0027s production In Country (1989). He gave up television writing and concentrated on acting. Slowly his roles grew larger (and more varied). He was Mark Harmon\u0027s chain-smoking detective partner Earl Gaddis on Reasonable Doubts (1991) and Edward Asner\u0027s dim-witted mechanic assistant Leland on Thunder Alley (1994). He was frequently cast in Westerns (Geronimo: An American Legend (1993), Bad Girls (1994), among many others) or as detectives, sheriffs, or police officers (Sister Act (1992), Sliver (1993), Joy Ride (2001)). After two seasons on 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996) as French Stewart\u0027s sullen bar-owner boss Happy Doug, Beaver landed his most prominent and critically acclaimed role, that of Ellsworth, the gruff but decent and beloved prospector in the landmark Western series Deadwood (2004). Nominated along with other cast members for a 2006 Screen Actors Guild Award, he found his career in high gear following that series. From it he moved to the popular father-figure role of demon hunter Bobby Singer on Supernatural (2005), a part that brought him a worldwide fan base and a secondary career making personal appearances. He was married to and had a daughter with Cecily Adams, the actress-casting director daughter of Get Smart (1965)\u0027s Don Adams. Following her death from lung cancer in 2004, he wrote a best-selling memoir, \"Life\u0027s That Way.\" He has continued to write plays and, between acting jobs, to work on the George Reeves project, now planned as a book. He served as biographical consultant on Reeves for the semi-biopic Hollywoodland (2006).",

Her mother was American-born, with Dutch and English ancestry, and was a teacher of English. Rebecca attended Berkeley High School where her nickname was the \"Jolly Blond Giant\", then she attended the University of California at Santa Cruz where she majored in Music, but left in 1995. She was a natural for modeling, and has posed for Sports Illustrated, Christian Dior and Victoria\u0027s Secret, to name but a few. Rebecca first met John Stamos in 1994, at a Victoria\u0027s Secret Fashion Show and had her first date with him at Disneyland. They married in September 1998, but have since gotten divorced. Rebecca\u0027s favorite foods are fillet mignon, tuna sashimi and Häagen-Dazs Cappuccino Commotion ice cream. But to keep her weight at a svelte 130 pounds, she stays fit with a rigorous stretching and strengthening routine (her firm body tone is evident when compared to photos of her earlier modeling, where she was very slim but not toned). Rebecca\u0027s most famous movie role, so far, was as the shapeshifting Mystique in X-Men (2000), based on the long-running comic book series about teenage mutant superheroes (that Jack Kirby and Stan Lee created in 1962). To play Mystique every day, Rebecca had to start out nude, and then two female makeup artists would apply blue body paint and other stick-on parts for 8 hours a day. Rebecca told Jay Leno on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992) that things like tissue paper would stick to her hips; and, one day, the long hours of wearing sticky paint makeup made her so upset that director Bryan Singer told her to have a glass of white wine and relax. Notwithstanding those technical difficulties, X-Men (2000) was a box-office bonanza, and Rebecca\u0027s future in films was assured.",

But Christian wanted to try out acting, so he took his truck and his life savings of a few hundred dollars and headed to Hollywood. Christian had many jobs, including mail-room clerk for a talent agency. His big break came when he played Ryan \"Flyboy\" Legget, the male lead, in a new show called Fame L.A.

Christian\u0027s next role was on Aaron Spelling\u0027s Rescue 77 (1999), where he played Wick Lobo a.k.a \"cowboy\" because of his radical application of \"gutter\" medicine. Due to poor ratings, the show was canceled. Not to be defeated, Christian was soon cast as a production assistant in Edtv (1999) starring Woody Harrelson as well as a made-for-TV Western called Crossfire Trail (2001) with Tom Selleck.

    "miniBio": "Matthew McConaughey was born in Uvalde, Texas. His mother, Mary Kathleen (McCabe), is a substitute school teacher originally from New Jersey. His father, James Donald McConaughey, was a Mississippi-born gas station owner who ran an oil pipe supply business. He is of Scottish, Irish, English, German, and Swedish descent. Matthew grew up in Longview, Texas, where he graduated from the local High School (1988). Showing little interest in his father\u0027s oil business, which his two brothers later joined, Matthew was longing for a change of scenery, and spent a year in Australia, washing dishes and shoveling chicken manure. Back to the States, he attended the University of Texas in Austin, originally wishing to be a lawyer. But, when he discovered an inspirational Og Mandino book \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" before one of his final exams, he suddenly knew he had to change his major from law to film. He began his acting career in 1991, appearing in student films and commercials in Texas and directed short films as Chicano Chariots (1992). Once, in his hotel bar in Austin, he met the casting director and producer Don Phillips, who introduced him to director Richard Linklater for his next project. At first, Linklater thought Matthew was too handsome to play the role of a guy chasing high school girls in his coming-of-age drama Dazed and Confused (1993), but cast him after Matthew grew out his hair and mustache. His character was initially in three scenes but the role grew to more than 300 lines as Linklater encouraged him to do some improvisations. In 1995, he starred in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994), playing a mad bloodthirsty sadistic killer, opposite Renée Zellweger. Shortly thereafter moving to L.A., Matthew became a sensation with his performances in two high-profile 1996 films Lone Star (1996), where he portrayed killing suspected sheriff and in the film adaptation of John Grisham\u0027s novel A Time to Kill (1996), where he played an idealistic young lawyer opposite Sandra Bullock and Kevin Spacey. The actor was soon being hailed as one of the industry\u0027s hottest young leading man inspiring comparisons to actor Paul Newman. His following performances were Robert Zemeckis\u0027 Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster (the film was finished just before the death of the great astronomer and popularizer of space science Carl Sagan) and Steven Spielberg\u0027s Amistad (1997), a fact-based 1839 story about the rebellious African slaves. In 1998, he teamed again with Richard Linklater as one of the bank-robbing brothers in The Newton Boys (1998), set in Matthew\u0027s birthplace, Uvalde, Texas. During this time, he also wrote, directed and starred in the 20-minute short The Rebel (1998). Later, in Jonathan Mostow\u0027s Submarino U-571 (2000), McConaughey portrayed the officer Lt. Tyler in a WW II story of a daring mission of American submariners, trying to capture the Enigma cipher machine. Matthew also took a part in comedies such as The Wedding Planner (2001), opposite Jennifer Lopez and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) in which he co-starred with Kate Hudson. He played a role as Denton Van Zan, an American warrior and dragons hunter in the futuristic thriller Reign of Fire (2002), where he co-starred with another young actor, Christian Bale. Later in 2006 he starred as head coach Jack Lengyel in We Are Marshall (2006) along with Matthew Fox, and in 2008 played treasure hunter Benjamin \"Finn\" Finnegan in Fool\u0027s Gold (2008) with Kate Hudson. After playing Connor Mead in Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (2009) co-starring with Jennifer Garner, McConaughey took a 2 year hiatus to open different kinds of opportunities in his career. And for many, that change came in 2011 in his first movie after that pause, when he portrayed criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller in The Lincoln Lawyer (2011), that operates mostly from the back seat of his Lincoln car. After this performance that was considered one of his best until then, Matthew played other iconic characters as district attorney Danny Buck Davidson in Bernie (2011), the wild private detective \"Killer\" Joe Cooper in Killer Joe (2011), Mud in Mud (2012), male stripper club owner Dallas in Magic Mike (2012) starring Channing Tatum. McConaughey\u0027s career certainly reached it\u0027s prime, when he played HIV carrier Ron Woodroof in the biographical drama _Dallas Buyers Club (2013)_, that was shot in less than a month. Matthew won the Best Actor in the 86th Academy Awards for his portrayal of Ron. Meanwhile, he starred in HBO\u0027s _True Detective (2014)_, as detective Rustin Cohle, whose job is to investigate with his partner Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, a gruesome murder that happened in his little town in Louisiana. The series was highly acclaimed by critics winning 4 of the 7 categories it was nominated at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards. Later in 2014, Matthew starred in Christopher Nolan\u0027s sci-fi film Interstellar (2014), playing Cooper, a former NASA pilot.",

    "miniBio": "Academy Award-nominee Woody Harrelson was born on July 23, 1961 in Midland, Texas, to Diane Lou (Oswald) and Charles Harrelson. He grew up in Lebanon, Ohio, and, after receiving degrees in theater arts and English from Hanover College, had a brief stint in New York theater. He was soon cast as Woody on TV series Cheers (1982), which wound up being one of the most-popular TV shows ever and also earned Harrelson an Emmy for his performance in 1989. While he dabbled in film during his time on Cheers (1982), that area of his career didn\u0027t fully take off until towards the end of the show\u0027s run. In 1991, Doc Hollywood (1991) gave him his first widely-seen movie role, and he followed that up with White Men Can\u0027t Jump (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993) and Natural Born Killers (1994). Recently, Harrelson has been seen in No Country for Old Men (2007), Zombieland (2009), 2012 (2009), and Friends with Benefits (2011), along with the acclaimed HBO movie Game Change (2012). In 2011, Harrelson snagged the coveted role of fan-favorite drunk Haymitch Abernathy in the big-screen adaptation of The Hunger Games (2012), which ended up being one of the highest-grossing movies ever at the domestic box office. Harrelson is set to reprise that role for the sequels, which are scheduled for release in November 2013, 2014 and 2015. Harrelson has received two Academy Award nominations, first for his role as controversial Hustler founder Larry Flynt in The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996) and then for a role in The Messenger (2009). He also received Golden Globe nominations for both of these parts. Harrelson was briefly married to Nancy Simon in the 80s, and later married his former assistant, Laura Louie, with whom he has three daughters.",

By junior high, he opted to put modeling on the back burner and focus more on sports and school. A few years later, when the opportunity to model in Europe arose, Somerhalder grabbed it, embarking on an enriching path of work, travel and study that took him to cities, including Paris, Milan and London. At 17, he began studying acting in New York and, by 19, had committed himself to the craft, working with preeminent acting coach William Esper. His fate was sealed while working as an extra in a club scene in the feature film, Black \u0026 White (1999). A talent manager visiting a client on the set spotted Somerhalder in a crowd scene of 400 and immediately signed him for representation. Happy to be anchored in New York, Somerhalder spends much of his time studying acting, writing and practicing yoga. His recreational interests include water and snow skiing and horseback riding.",

Until the age of 17 his life was spent at school and working on the family farm, morning and night-something he continues to relish on his trips back home. After high school, higher education called and he was accepted to Melbourne University. It was not long until his intense curiosity led him to begin his global adventures. While bar-tending in London, giving away almost as much beer as he sold, he met his would-be manager, David Seltzer. David saw a spark in Travis and suggested he move to the United States to become an actor and nurture his talent. Easily enticed by the arts, it was not long before Travis made the move to Los Angeles, and within a week began studying with renowned acting coach Ivana Chubbuck. The teaching veteran, in addition to Travis, has mentored Jake Gyllenhaal, Eva Mendes, Halle Berry, Brad Pitt and Charlize Theron. Years of struggling and hard work continue to pay off and Travis has chalked up starring roles in several projects including Rocky Point (with Lauren Holly), Southern Comfort (with Madeleine Stowe and Eric Roberts), Restraint (with True Blood\u0027s Stephen Moyer), Ivory (with Martin Landau and Peter Stomare), Surfer Dude (with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson), and AE\u0027s The Beast (with Patrick Swayze). Production has taken Travis all over the world but, between roles, he travels back to his family\u0027s farm as much as possible. Travis is quick to point out that it is his love for Australian Rules (AKA \"No\" Rules) Football, the countryside, his two older brothers, and a hard working lifestyle that keeps his feet firmly planted on the ground.",

    "miniBio": "Courteney Cox was born on June 15th, 1964 in Birmingham, Alabama, into an affluent Southern family. She is the daughter of Courteney (Bass) and Richard Lewis Cox (1930-2001), a businessman. She was the baby of the family with two older sisters (Virginia and Dottie) and an older brother, Richard, Jr. She was raised in an exclusive society town, Mountain Brook, Alabama. Courteney was the archetypal daddy\u0027s girl, and therefore was understandably devastated when, in 1974, her parents divorced, and her father moved to Florida. She became a rebellious teen, and did not make things easy for her mother, and new stepfather, New York businessman Hunter Copeland. Now, she is great friends with both. She attended Mountain Brook High School, where she was a cheerleader, tennis player and swimmer. In her final year, she received her first taste of modeling. She appeared in an advert for the store, Parisians. Upon graduation, she left Alabama to study architecture and interior design at Mount Vernon College. After one year she dropped out to a pursue a modeling career in New York, after being signed by the prestigious Ford Modelling Agency. She appeared on the covers of teen magazines such as Tiger Beat and Little Miss, plus numerous romance novels. She then moved on to commercials for Maybeline, Noxema, New York Telephone Company and Tampax. While modeling, she attended acting classes, as her real dream and ambition was to be an actress. In 1984, she landed herself a small part in one episode of As the World Turns (1956) as a young débutante named Bunny. Her first big break, however, was being cast by Brian De Palma in the Bruce Springsteen video \"Dancing in The Dark\". In 1985, she moved to LA to star alongside Dean Paul Martin in Misfits of Science (1985). It was a flop, but a few years later, she was chosen out of thousands of hopefuls to play Michael J. Fox\u0027s girlfriend, psychology major Lauren Miller in Family Ties (1982). In 1989, Family Ties (1982) ended, and Cox went through a lean spell in her career, featuring in unmemorable movies such as Mr. Destiny (1990) with Michael Caine. Fortunes changed dramatically for Cox, when in 1994, she starred alongside Jim Carrey in the unexpected hit Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), and a year later she was cast as Monica Geller on the hugely successful sitcom Friends (1994). It was this part that turned her into an international superstar and led to an American Comedy Award nomination. In 1996 Cox starred in Wes Craven\u0027s horror/comedy Scream (1996) . This movie grossed over $100 million at the box office, and won Cox rave reviews for her standout performance as the wickedly bitchy and smug TV reporter Gale Weathers. She went on to play this character again in each of the three sequels. Not only did her involvement in this movie lead to critical acclaim, but it also led to her meeting actor husband David Arquette. He played her on-screen love interest Dewey, and life imitated art as the two fell in love for real. Their wedding took place in San Francisco, at the historic Grace Cathedral atop Nob Hill, on June 12th, 1999. Joined by 200 guests, including Cox\u0027s film star friends Liam Neeson and Kevin Spacey, the happy couple finally became Mr. and Mrs. Arquette.",

(Stern), was a travel agent, and her father, Lee N. Kudrow, was a physician. Her parents are both from Jewish immigrant families (from Belarus, Russia, and Hungary). Lisa was raised in Tarzana and played varsity-level tennis in high school and college, and is a pool shark who has mastered some of the more difficult trick shots (so beware). She graduated from Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychobiology. At first, she wanted to pursue a career in research, so she returned to Los Angeles to begin working with her father. However, Lisa got inspired to perform by one of her brother\u0027s friends, comedian Jon Lovitz, and so the tall (5\u0027 8\") blond-haired, green-eyed beauty entered show biz. Lisa auditioned for the improv theater group, The Groundlings, based in Los Angeles. Cynthia Szigeti, a well-known improv teacher, took Lisa under her wing. In that class, Lisa became a friend of Conan O\u0027Brien. Graduating with honors in 1989, Lisa became a full-fledged member of The Groundlings. Breaking into TV, she got a recurring role as Ursula, the ditsy waitress on Mad About You (1992). This led to her starring role on Friends (1994). In the debut season (1994-95) of Friends (1994), Lisa earned an Emmy nomination as Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series; in 1998, she won that award for her role as Phoebe, the ditsy but lovable folk singer. Lisa has also been nominated for Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild and American Comedy Awards for her performances. Lisa made the transition to the big screen with a lot of success. In 1997, she starred opposite Oscar winner Mira Sorvino in the above-mentioned Romy and Michele\u0027s High School Reunion (1997).

    "id": "nm0000228",
    "miniBio": "As enigmatic as he is talented, Kevin Spacey has always kept the details of his private life closely guarded. As he explained in a 1998 interview with the London Evening Standard, \"the less you know about me, the easier it is to convince you that I am that character on screen. It allows an audience to come into a movie theatre and believe I am that person\". There are, however, certain biographical facts to be had - for starters, Kevin Spacey Fowler was the youngest of three children born to Kathleen Ann (Knutson) and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, in South Orange, New Jersey. His ancestry includes Swedish (from his maternal grandfather) and English. His mother was a personal secretary, his father a technical writer whose irregular job prospects led the family all over the country. The family eventually settled in southern California, where young Kevin developed into quite a little hellion - after he set his sister\u0027s tree house on fire, he was shipped off to the Northridge Military Academy, only to be thrown out a few months later for pinging a classmate on the head with a tire. Spacey then found his way to Chatsworth High School in the San Fernando Valley, where he managed to channel his dramatic tendencies into a successful amateur acting career. In his senior year, he played \"Captain von Trapp\" opposite classmate Mare Winningham\u0027s \"Maria\" in \"The Sound of Music\" (the pair later graduated as co-valedictorians). Spacey claims that his interest in acting - and his nearly encyclopedic accumulation of film knowledge - began at an early age, when he would sneak downstairs to watch the late late show on TV. Later, in high school, he and his friends cut class to catch revival films at the NuArt Theater. The adolescent Spacey worked up celebrity impersonations (James Stewart and Johnny Carson were two of his favorites) to try out on the amateur comedy club circuit. He briefly attended Los Angeles Valley College, then left (on the advice of another Chatsworth classmate, Val Kilmer) to join the drama program at Juilliard. After two years of training he was anxious to work, so he quit Juilliard sans diploma and signed up with the New York Shakespeare Festival. His first professional stage appearance was as a messenger in the 1981 production of \"Henry VI\". Festival head Joseph Papp ushered the young actor out into the \"real world\" of theater, and the next year Spacey made his Broadway debut in Henrik Ibsen\u0027s \"Ghosts\". He quickly proved himself as an energetic and versatile performer (at one point, he rotated through all the parts in David Rabe\u0027s \"Hurlyburly\"). In 1986, he had the chance to work with his idol and future mentor, Jack Lemmon, on a production of Eugene O\u0027Neill\u0027s \"Long Day\u0027s Journey Into Night\". While his interest soon turned to film, Spacey would remain active in the theater community - in 1991, he won a Tony Award for his turn as \"Uncle Louie\" in Neil Simon\u0027s Broadway hit \"Lost in Yonkers\" and, in 1999, he returned to the boards for a revival of O\u0027Neill\u0027s \"The Iceman Cometh\". Spacey\u0027s film career began modestly, with a small part as a subway thief in Heartburn (1986). Deemed more of a \"character actor\" than a \"leading man\", he stayed on the periphery in his next few films, but attracted attention for his turn as beady-eyed villain \"Mel Profitt\" on the TV series Wiseguy (1987). Profitt was the first in a long line of dark, manipulative characters that would eventually make Kevin Spacey a household name: he went on to play a sinister office manager in Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), a sadistic Hollywood exec in Swimming with Sharks (1994), and, most famously, creepy, smooth-talking eyewitness Verbal Kint in The Usual Suspects (1995). The \"Suspects\" role earned Spacey an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor and catapulted him into the limelight. That same year, he turned in another complex, eerie performance in David Fincher\u0027s thriller Se7en (1995) (Spacey refused billing on the film, fearing that it might compromise the ending if audiences were waiting for him to appear). By now, the scripts were pouring in. After appearing in Al Pacino\u0027s Looking for Richard (1996), Spacey made his own directorial debut with Albino Alligator (1996), a low-key but well received hostage drama. He then jumped back into acting, winning critical accolades for his turns as flashy detective Jack Vincennes in L.A. Confidential (1997) and genteel, closeted murder suspect Jim Williams in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997). In October 1999, just four days after the dark suburban satire American Beauty (1999) opened in US theaters, Spacey received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Little did organizers know that his role in Beauty would turn out to be his biggest success yet - as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged corporate cog on the brink of psychological meltdown, he tapped into a funny, savage character that captured audiences\u0027 imaginations and earned him a Best Actor Oscar. No longer relegated to offbeat supporting parts, Spacey seems poised to redefine himself as a Hollywood headliner. He says he\u0027s finished exploring the dark side - but, given his attraction to complex characters, that mischievous twinkle will never be too far from his eyes. In February 2003 Spacey made a major move back to the theatre. He was appointed Artistic Director of the new company set up to save the famous Old Vic theatre, The Old Vic Theatre Company. Although he did not undertake to stop appearing in movies altogether, he undertook to remain in this leading post for ten years, and to act in as well as to direct plays during that time. His first production, of which he was the director, was the September 2004 British premiere of the play Cloaca by Maria Goos (made into a film, Cloaca (2003)). Spacey made his UK Shakespearean debut in the title role in Richard II in 2005. In 2006 he got movie director Robert Altman to direct for the stage the little-known Arthur Miller play Resurrection Blues, but that was a dismal failure. However Spacey remained optimistic, and insisted that a few mistakes are part of the learning process. He starred thereafter with great success in Eugene O\u0027Neill\u0027s A Moon for the Misbegotten along with Colm Meaney and Eve Best, and in 2007 that show transferred to Broadway. In February 2008 Spacey put on a revival of the David Mamet 1988 play Speed-the-Plow in which he took one of the three roles, the others being taken by Jeff Goldblum and Laura Michelle Kelly. In 2013, Spacey took on the lead role in an original Netflix series, House of Cards. Based upon a British show of the same name, House of Cards is an American political drama. The show\u0027s first season received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination to include outstanding lead actor in a drama series.",

    "miniBio": "Michel is a first generation American born in Manhattan on April 16,1960 to parents who narrowly survived the Holocaust. They themselves sprung from the Great Diaspora, which began for their parents in Moscow, Odessa, Kiev and the Ukraine. Michel\u0027s mother, Nadine Gill, lives in New York, his father, James Vladimir Gill, lived in Switzerland until his death in 1995. James was less pre-occupied with having survived the horrible events of the 30\u0027s and 40\u0027s and more concerned about how he was going to survive survival. Michel has three sisters and often wondered, growing up, if he shouldn\u0027t have been called Andre. Nina, Kitty and Natasha are sprinkled around the globe and have no desire to return to Moscow ... so ... there endeth the Chekhov analogy. His first language was French his second, English ... then came Latin, Greek, German and Russian. At this juncture, he\u0027s amazed he can ask where the \u0027can\u0027 is in one of them! Michel is thrilled to be playing POTUS in the NETFLIX production of \"House of Cards.\" His fascination with US Presidents began at the age of 3, during the year he and his family lived in Paris. He can vividly recall studying the picture of that boy saluting a casket on that famous edition of Paris Match. Michel felt he was that boy ... dressed the same way; shorts, powder-blue coat ... slighly knock-kneed. We were all that little boy and we had all lost a father figure. How could a nation heal from such devastation? What untold secrets rested not so peacefully at Arlington Cemetery? Michel has always been absorbed with the not so delicate balance between the secrets presidents keep and the little we, the people, know. How, as a nation, we offset those two and inform ourselves without tipping over into invention, conspiracy theory or pettiness. Now, as President Garrett Walker, he can finally pretend to know. Information was on tap in the Gill residence; at any given time, a telex was chickchickchick-ing away with AP, Reuters, Commodity Exchange and Foreign Exchange updates. James was in the world of high finance but was like the proverbial Jewish mother with a thermometer, taking the geo-political temperature every 30 minutes. Such was the way in the Gill household, where James wanted to insure that if the world were ever to go mad again he would know about it before anyone else did. Back from his year in France, Michel, now 4, became best friends with a boy named Michael who happened to be the son of a violinist named Isaac. One day, this fella Isaac leaned in close to Michel and fiddled a few measures of the Bach double violin concerto; Michel\u0027s eyes welled up with tears. This prompted Isaac to perform an impromptu hearing test on this very sensitive boy and to Michel\u0027s misfortune, diagnosed him with perfect pitch. Nothing could have been more exciting to James than the thought of having sired a wunderkind. Isaac recommended that James not wait to put a violin in the boy\u0027s arms, and so Michel soon thereafter began taking violin classes with the father of a kid named Yo-Yo. Before he knew it, Michel and his violin were thrust into explosive relationships; the former with a fiendish spirit called Perfectionism and the latter with walls. And although it took Michel years to shake off that demon, he always knew he wanted to be just like Isaac and that whatever he was going to do with his life, he would somehow draw a bow on people\u0027s heart strings and create his own kind of sound. Michel began his acting career at the tender age of 5 when he pretended to be ecstatic about the birth of his 3rd sister Natalie. Since then, he has pretended to be some of the most important characters in dramatic history, starting with Chief Sitting Bull doing his great rain dance-and-chant around the fire pit at that Jewish Indian camp up in Maine. Michel participated in his first presidential campaign in 1968 when he passed out Bobby Kennedy buttons in front of the Red Apple supermarket on the Upper Westside. But after Bobby and Martin were gunned down, and Tricky Dicky was voted in, James decided the US was no longer a safe place for his family; escape was all he knew ... and so, in 1970, he moved the whole family to Lausanne, Switzerland, where Michel pretty much remained until he graduated high school. After a rough year at Tufts University, he dropped out and worked at ABC News for a year in the film and video library where he continued sealing his bond with information. He then lived in London for a year; a workshop at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art convinced him that theatre was where his passions lay. He auditioned for and was accepted at the Juilliard School of Drama, which he considers to be far better than Yale. His beloved wife of 15 years, Jayne Atkinson, vehemently disagrees. She happens to be on House of Cards as well, playing Catherine Durant, the Secretary of State, so he\u0027s her boss for now, and he gets the last word. His greatest rewards are and forever will be those of being a husband and father. Michel and Jayne have wanted to teach acting together for many years and are excited about developing master classes and workshops for actors young and old, beginners and experienced, amateur and professional. They want to focus on teaching what they know, what they do and what they love.",

He has three younger siblings. Murphy was educated at Presentation Brothers College, Cork. He went on to study law at University College Cork, but dropped out after about a year. During this time Murphy also pursued an interest in music, playing guitar in various bands. Upon leaving University, Murphy joined the Corcadorca Theater Company in Cork, and played the lead role in \"Disco Pigs\", amongst other plays. Various film roles followed, including a film adaptation of Disco Pigs (2001). However, his big film break came when he was cast in Danny Boyle\u0027s 28 Days Later... (2002), which became a surprise international hit. This performance earned him nominations for Best Newcomer at the Empire Awards and Breakthrough Male Performance at the MTV Movie Awards. Murphy went on to supporting roles in high-profile films such as Cold Mountain (2003) and Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003), and then was cast in two villain roles: Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka The Scarecrow, in Batman Begins (2005) and Jackson Rippner in Red Eye (2005). Although slight in nature for a villain, Murphy\u0027s piercing blue eyes helped to create creepy performances and critics began to take notice. Manhola Dargis of the New York Times cited Murphy as a \"picture-perfect villain\", while David Denby of The New Yorker noted he was both \"seductive\" and \"sinister\". Later that year, Murphy starred as Patrick \"Kitten\" Braden, an Irish transgender in search of her mother, in Neil Jordan\u0027s Breakfast on Pluto (2005), a film adaptation of the Pat McCabe novel. Although the film was not a box office success, Murphy was nominated for a Golden Globes for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical and he won Best Actor for the Irish Film and Television Academy Awards. The following year, Murphy starred in Ken Loach\u0027s Brisa de Mudança (2006). The film was the most successful independent Irish film and won the Palm D\u0027Or at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Murphy continued to take roles in a number of independent films, and also reprised his role as the Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan\u0027s The Dark Knight (2008). Nolan is known for working with actors in multiple films, and cast Murphy in Inception (2010), as Robert Fischer, the young heir of the multi-billion dollar empire, who was the target of DiCaprio\u0027s dream team. Murphy continues to appear in high profile films such as In Time (2011), Red Lights (2012), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012), the final film in Nolan\u0027s Batman trilogy. Murphy is married to Yvonne McGuinness, an artist. The couple has two sons, Malachy and Carrick.",

    "miniBio": "Ed O\u0027Neill is an American actor best known for playing Al Bundy on Married with Children (1987), the most iconic working class character on television since Archie Bunker. Upon his debut on the world stage in Youngstown, Ohio on April 12, 1946, he was christened Ed, Jr. Both his father Ed, Sr., a steelworker and truck driver, and his social worker mother, the former Ruth Ann Quinlan, were Irish Americans. A gifted athlete, the 6\u00271\" O\u0027Neil attended Ohio University on a football scholarship, but transferred after his sophomore year to Youngstown State University, where he played as a defensive lineman. In 1969, he was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers, but was cut in training camp. (Al Bundy was a former high-school football star constantly reminiscing about his glory days on the high school gridiron. Terry Bradshaw, the Hall of Fame Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback, twice appeared on \"Married with Children\".) After being cut by the Steelers, O\u0027Neill went back to YSU to join the new theater department. After graduating, he became a social studies teacher at his alma mater, Ursuline High School, before fully committing to acting. He was a member of the company at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the top regional theaters in America. After numerous supporting parts in movies and television, he was cast as the New York City detective Popeye Doyle in the 1986 television movie that was a pilot for a proposed television series. \"Popeye Doyle\" was based on the classic police drama The French Connection (1971), with O\u0027Neil playing the role originated by Gene Hackman). The television movie and O\u0027Neil\u0027s performance got good reviews, but it was not picked up as a series. A year later, O\u0027Neill was cast as Al Bundy in the sitcom \"Married with Children\", which debuted on the then-new Fox Network in April 1987. It ran 10 years, until June 1997, and made O\u0027Neil a star. During the production of \"Married with Children\" and after its cancellation, O\u0027Neill appeared in movies, guested on television shows, and made television commercials. The second iconic fictional policeman role that O\u0027Neill took over was Sgt. Joe Friday in his 2003 remake of Jack Webb\u0027s classic crime series Dragnet (2003), which appeared on ABC. The network canceled the show during its second season. Since 2009, O\u0027Neill has played Jay Pritchett on the ABC\u0027s sitcom Modern Family (2009), for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2011. Since 1986, O\u0027Neil has been married to actress Catherine Rusoff. They have two daughters, Claire and Sophia.",

In fact, it wasn\u0027t until high school that Cobie started to explore acting after appearing in several school productions. As a teenager, Cobie caught the eye of a modeling agency, which led to several years of world travel to places such as France, Japan, Italy, Greece, and Germany. Yet even as Cobie\u0027s modeling career was on the rise, she still managed to attend school, graduating from high school in 2000 with honors. Once out of high school, Cobie continued modeling internationally until the opportunity arose to audition for film and television. It was not long before Cobie\u0027s natural ability as an actress impressed casting directors, landing her guest spots on television series such as Special Unit 2 (2001) and Jeremiah (2002). In addition, Cobie also appeared in the short Candy from Strangers (2001) directed by fellow Canadian rising star Eric Johnson. Cobie got her big break just months later when she landed the role of Juliet Droil in the ABC program Veritas: The Quest (2003). The series marked her first series role for television.",

    "id": "nm0002536",
    "miniBio": "It would seem that 2004, the year of her 18th birthday, will be remembered as pivotal for Emmy Rossum due to her appearance in two very different films, The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and The Phantom of the Opera (2004). Emmy\u0027s performance in the latter film gained her a Golden Globe nomination. Emmanuelle Grey Rossum was born in New York City, where she was raised by her single mother, Cheryl Rossum, a corporate photographer (she has only met her father a few times). Her mother is of Russian Jewish descent and her father has English and Dutch ancestry. After passing an audition at the Metropolitan Opera when she was 7 years old, Rossum performed in more than 20 operas in six different languages at Lincoln Center, alongside such figures as Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. She was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in \"Carmen.\" She left the opera when she entered her teenage years, as she had grown too tall to perform as a child. Emmy also appeared in a Carnegie Hall presentation of \"The Damnation of Faust.\" She graduated from the Spence School, a private institution in Manhattan, in 1996 and then earned a high school diploma when 15 years old by taking online extension courses offered by Stanford University (Education Program for Gifted Youth). She later enrolled at Columbia University and studied art history and French. In a change of venue, Emmy created the role of Abigail Williams in the daytime soap opera As the World Turns (1956) in 1997 and branched out in performances in the made-for-television movies Genius (1999) and The Audrey Hepburn Story (2000), in which she played the title character as a young teenager. Other television work included Snoops (1999), Law \u0026 Order (1990), and The Practice (1997). Emmy made her theatrical feature debut in the indie film Songcatcher (2000), with her good friend Rhoda Griffis, which won the Special Jury Award for Outstanding Ensemble Performance at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2000. Rossum received an Independent Spirit Award nomination in the category of Best Debut Performance for her performance as an Appalachian orphan. She played an aspiring songwriter (the title character) in the romantic comedy Nola (2003). Cast as the ill-fated daughter of a small-business owner in Clint Eastwood\u0027s Mystic River (2003), she projected an aura of innocence that made her character\u0027s tragic death memorable and heartbreaking. This was her first major studio film. After six months of filming her role as the fresh-faced but highly intelligent teenage damsel in distress The Day After Tomorrow (2004) in Montreal, she returned to New York and screen-tested for the role of Christine in The Phantom of the Opera (2004) in full costume and makeup, and was finally selected for the part by Andrew Lloyd Webber after singing for him at his home. Although she was surprised to be chosen ahead of many better-known and older actresses considered for the part, the combination of her vulnerable, fragile beauty and fine, classically trained singing voice ultimately proved that she was perfectly cast. In preparation for the role, she took ballet classes for two months and started polishing her singing. Emmy has commented that, in her approach to acting, she draws heavily upon her own experiences, so she visited locations in Paris and conjured up what she terms \"past memories\" to draw upon in making her performance emotionally realistic. She stood on the roof of the Opéra Garnier, where Christine sings \"All I Ask of You,\" and went underneath the opera house, where there is actually a gloomy, dark lake. She studied Degas\u0027s paintings of ballerinas in the Musée d\u0027Orsay to learn how to stand like one. Her next project Poseidon (2006) was a mainstream effort, but since its release, she has been more true to advice she obtained from Sean Penn when making Mystic River (2003), that she should be picky and only accept roles that are fun to do, such as Dragonball: Evolution (2009).",

    "miniBio": "On the viewing horizon since the late 1980s, actress Maura Tierney has been a steady product of independent features, some hits and some misses, for close to a decade and a half. An odd and compelling beauty, she came from an upperscale Bostonian family and was raised in the Hyde Park district. Born February 3, 1965, the eldest child of three to a prosperous politician and city councilman father and real estate agent mother, Maura initially studied at New York University but left school prior to graduation when she hooked up with the Circle-in-the-Square theater school. Following some stage plays including \"Baby with the Bathwater\" and \"Danny and the Deep Blue Sea,\" she moved to the West Coast in the late 1980s finding minor roles here and there in TV-movies and making the rounds on episodic shows such as Growing Pains (1985), Family Ties (1982) and Law \u0026 Order (1990). She met actor/husband Billy Morrissette after both were fired from the set of an eventually-scrapped Ralph Macchio series. After a few other failed pilots and a short-lived TV series, Maura made a minor film debut with The Linguini Incident (1991) and progressed to leading lady status in the B-movie spoof Dead Women in Lingerie (1991), which didn\u0027t go over well. She finally hit paydirt on TV when she won a female co-lead as smart but insecure newswriter Lisa Miller on the comedy series NewsRadio (1995). The show sailed along for a number of seasons due to the fine comedy instincts of Dave Foley, Andy Dick and the late Saturday Night Live (1975) player Phil Hartman. The show lost its oomph, however, as well as its audience after Hartman\u0027s tragic 1998 shotgun slaying, despite an assured replacement in fellow Saturday Night Live (1975) alumni Jon Lovitz. The show couldn\u0027t escape its bad aura, and it was gone the following year. Maura\u0027s work on the TV sitcom thrust her into the film comedy limelight with prominent roles in such films as the Jim Carrey vehicle Liar Liar (1997). She also showed up as sly, darker-edged femmes in the thriller Primal Fear (1996), Escândalos do Candidato (1998) and Instinct (1999). She received one of her best art-house roles as a heavy in her husband\u0027s feature Scotland, Pa. (2001)--he wrote and directed. It was back to steady TV work, however, into the millennium with the role of Abby, who was first a nurse and then a doctor, in the long-established and critically-acclaimed medical drama series ER (1994), where she still resides on the staff. The L.A.-based actress and her husband enjoy traveling in their spare time.",

    "miniBio": "Canadian-born actor Nathan Fillion gained critical acclaim and a large cult of fans when he starred as Captain Malcolm Reynolds on the Joss Whedon TV series Firefly (2002), having previously been a regular on One Life to Live (1968) and Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998). Fillion had also appeared in small roles in the films Blast from the Past (1999) and Saving Private Ryan (1998). Whedon gave Fillion a chance to display his range when he cast Fillion as the twisted preacher Caleb, a villain, in the seventh and final season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997). When Firefly (2002) was prematurely canceled in late 2002, the show\u0027s cast, crew, and many fans were devastated. Whedon vowed to resurrect the series in some way, and Fillion played Captain Reynolds again in the feature-film Serenity (2005). Fillion followed this film with more big screen leading roles in the horror-comedy Slither - Os Invasores (2006) and the indie hit Waitress (2007). He also continued to be a force in television, starring in the short-lived Fox-TV series Drive (2007) and appearing on ABC\u0027s Desperate Housewives (2004). He took his first singing part (and cemented his cult appeal) as Captain Hammer in Whedon\u0027s musical Internet smash Dr. Horrible\u0027s Sing-Along Blog (2008).",

    "miniBio": "Originally groomed for the theater, Sullivan worked at the National Repertory Theatre in Washington D.C. before landing a role in Broadway opposite Dustin Hoffman in \"Jimmy Shine\". Sullivan continued appearing in theater while working on Falcon Crest (1981) in the 1980s. In the 1960s, Susan played \"Lenore Curtin\" on Another World (1964) for four years, a role that gave her much experience in television, and evidently had a lot of fun from what fellow co-stars (especially Nicolas Coster) have testified. Following her role, Sullivan was acting off-Broadway when an agent spotted her and encouraged her to move to Hollywood, signing her to a contract which was conditional upon her doing so. She went on to play a dozen different parts on TV before taking on the role that would win her an Emmy nomination; that of Peter Strauss\u0027 lover in the miniseries, Rich Man, Poor Man - Book II (1976). Sullivan then played a gynecologist in two TV movies, Having Babies II (1977) and Having Babies III (1978), which led to a role in the short-run series Having Babies (1978) (aka Julia Farr, M.D.). Sullivan then went on to become a member of the ensemble cast of It\u0027s a Living (1980). She attained her greatest success during the \u002780s when she played the often put-upon \"Maggie\" on Falcon Crest (1981). Throughout FC\u0027s run, Sullivan remained devoted to the theatre appearing in \"Fifth of July\" at the Mark Taper Forum in L.A. and \"Last Summer\" at Blue Fish Cove in San Francisco. Sullivan decided to leave FC at the start of its final season after seven seasons because she felt \"Maggie was repeating herself\". Sullivan looks back on her days at FC with pride, especially at her gutsy work when her character had a brief bout with alcohol, drawing on her memories of being the child of an alcoholic. After leaving FC, Sullivan continued her charity association with the Blue Cross and ACOA (Adult Children of Alcoholics). She then got the opportunity to play comedy in a guest stint in Doctor Doctor (1989). Sullivan then recorded two pilot comedies, \"Ruth Harper\" and \"Satellite News\". She then went on to play the recurring character of George Carlin\u0027s love interest on his self-titled show. While working on GC, she played Robert Urich\u0027s ex-wife in Danielle Steel\u0027s A Perfect Stranger (1994). In 1995, Sullivan returned to drama in ABC\u0027s The Monroes (1995) as \"Kathryn Monroe\", wife of political aspirant William Devane. Sullivan relished the role, and despite the show folding soon after, she received rave reviews, being dubbed the season\u0027s best actress. She was also singled out in publications as the show\u0027s saving grace. Sullivan continues to stay in touch with several Falcon Crest (1981) stars, including David Selby, and is now dating author Connell Cowan whom she has been seeing since 1989. Sullivan has a sister, Brigid, an executive at WGBH-TV in Boston, and a brother, Brendan, a methadone counselor in N.Y.C. Sullivan had no qualms about working as a bunny girl in the Manhattan Playboy Club (\"I had been a waitress before and I felt I would rather show my legs and make sixty dollars a night instead of twenty\"), where she recited Shakespeare while serving drinks. When she was twenty-three, Sullivan dated Cary Grant. Behind the scenes, stories of Susan indicate she is big on practical jokes and works hard at cracking the cast up. Her co-star on Falcon Crest (1981), David Selby (Richard) has recalled the time Susan went into the bathroom to slip into something more comfortable for her role, and when the passion of the scene reached fever-pitch, she dropped the robe to reveal a body-stocking crammed with bottles, cans and tubes of toothpaste. David and the rest of the crew fell about laughing hysterically. Sullivan has been a spokeswoman for Tylenol for many years, and is proud to be associated with the product (pointing out the fact that she has been able to buy a beach house with the proceeds). Attractive, intelligent and outspoken, Sullivan is a well-grounded and giving actress who brings much insight into whichever role she chooses to play.",

    "id": "nm0002127",
    "miniBio": "Mariska (Ma-rish-ka) Magdolna Hargitay was born on January 23, 1964, in Santa Monica, California. Her parents are Mickey Hargitay and Jayne Mansfield. She is the youngest of their three children. In June 1967, Mariska and her brothers Zoltan and Mickey Jr. were in the back seat of a car when it was involved in the fatal accident which killed her mother. The children escaped with minor injuries. Her father remarried a stewardess named Ellen, and they raised the three children and gave them a normal childhood. They also financially supported the children, since Jayne Mansfield\u0027s debt-ridden estate left no money for them. Mariska majored in theater at UCLA. Her first motion picture feature was the cult favorite, Ghoulies (1984), where she gave a memorable performance as Donna. Unlike her mother Jayne, who had changed her name, her hair color, and did nude pictorials to become a star, Mariska took a very different approach on her journey to become a star. She rejected advice to change her name and appearance. And she refused to copy her mother\u0027s sexy image by turning down nude scenes in her next film \"Road Trip\" (1985). She told casting directors that she was her own person when she held onto her dark locks and athletic figure, when they were expecting another blond, buxom Jayne Mansfield. Mariska continued with her acting classes and waited on tables, while she landed forgettable roles in short-lived television shows. She appeared a few times on the nighttime soap \"Falcon Crest\". She also appeared in the hit film Leaving Las Vegas (1995), credited as \u0027Hooker at the bar\u0027, and in the flop film Lake Placid (1999) as Myra Okubo. Her recurring role on the top-rated show \"ER\" in 1998 gave her career enough of a jolt to land her the starring role of Det. Olivia Benson in Law \u0026 Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), the first spin off from the excellent franchise of Law \u0026 Order (1990). The hour-long show deals with sex crimes and the detectives who solve these cases. Mariska played Olivia as a tough, compassionate detective, who did action scenes and her own stuntwork. She reaped the rewards from the hit tv show, after struggling and studying her craft for fifteen years. She became the highest paid actress on television, and she won Emmy and Golden Globe awards for her performance. The show also changed her personal life, since she met her husband actor Peter Hermann on the set and married him on August 28, 2004. That same year, she appeared in the television movie Plain Truth (2004), in which she played attorney Ellie Harrison. Mariska became an activist, when fans of her show who were abused, would write to her, and she founded a non-profit organization called \"Joyful Heart Foundation\" to help \"survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, and child abuse.\" Mariska gave birth to her son August in 2006. But that tremendous joy was soon followed by tremendous sadness when her beloved father Mickey died just two months later at the age of 80. Mariska and her husband Peter adopted two children, a girl named Amaya, and a boy named Andrew, within a span of few months in 2011. Mariska speaks English, Hungarian, French, Spanish, and Italian, and her husband also speaks several languages, including his native language German. They divide their time between New York and Los Angeles.",

    "picture": "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTYyODc0MTI2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYwMjk3Mw@@._V1_SY317_CR9,0,214,317_AL_.jpg",
    "id": "nm0005221",
    "miniBio": "Blessed with a piercing, blue-eyed glint, brawny looks, cocky \"tough guy\" stance and effortless charisma, TV\u0027s Christopher Meloni has grabbed audiences\u0027 attention, male and female alike, finding breakthrough small screen stardom playing both sides of the law. Audiences first were taken in by his sexually arresting portrayal of a sociopathic killer in the gripping prison drama Oz (1997) on cable TV. Although his small screen roots were in 90s situation comedy, the network powers-that-be wisely discovered his power and allure as a dramatic star and quickly handed him his own prime-time crime series, Law \u0026 Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), as a not-quite-by-the-book crime detective. This one-two punch of \"Oz\" and \"Law \u0026 Order: SVU\" put Meloni, who seems to grow sexier with age, on the map and well on top, where he remains today. Christopher Peter Meloni was born on April 2, 1961, in Washington, D.C., the son of Cecile (Chagnon) and Robert Meloni, an endocrinologist. Of Italian and French-Canadian parentage, he attended St. Stephen\u0027s School and played quarterback for his high school team. Developing an interest in acting rather early in life, he attended the University of Colorado at Boulder following high school graduation. He initially majored in acting but wound up earning a degree in history in 1983. Acting won out in the long run, however, and Chris relocated to New York where he studied with acting guru Sanford Meisner at the renowned Neighborhood Playhouse. Supplementing his income during these lean years by taking advantage of his powerful physique (as construction worker, bouncer, personal trainer), Meloni worked his way up the acting ladder via parts in commercials. With a full head of hair in the early days, he broke into series TV in 1989, the first being the already-established cable football comedy 1st \u0026 Ten: The Championship (1984). In this sitcom, which was HBO\u0027s very first back in 1984, Chris played ex-con quarterback Vito Del Greco (aka \"Johnny Gunn\"). The series\u0027 star Delta Burke had already left the cast by the time Chris came aboard in its final season. A second sitcom arrived almost immediately with the stereotypical Italian family sitcom The Fanelli Boys (1990) featuring Chris as dim-eyed, skirt-chasing Frankie Fanelli, one of the four \"dees, dem and dos\" sons of Brooklynite widow Theresa Fanelli (Ann Morgan Guilbert). Despite a strong, boisterous cast, the show was painfully obvious and met an early demise. True to nature, Chris gave voice and added to the fun as a cocky, mooching high school teen who knows the \"how to\u0027s\" of attracting pretty girl dinos in the animated prehistoric series Dinosaurs (1991). He also made a manly mark in mini-movies with co-starring roles in such \"women\" dramas as In a Child\u0027s Name (1991) starring Valerie Bertinelli, Something to Live for: The Alison Gertz Story (1992), which top-lined Molly Ringwald, Without a Kiss Goodbye (1993) as the caring husband of Lisa Hartman, and the Connie Sellecca starrer A Dangerous Affair (1995). An interchangeable ability to convey both heartfelt sympathy and virile menace did not go by unnoticed. After minor parts on the big screen with Clean Slate (1994), Junior (1994) and Twelve Monkeys (1995), Chris drew strong notices in the featured role of gangster Johnnie Marzzone in the classic neo-noir Bound (1996), which earned cult status for its sexually-charged lesbian sub-storyline. A tough recurring part on \"NYPD Blue\", a typical mafia role in the mini-series The Last Don (1997) and another short-lived comedic series lead (Leaving L.A. (1997)) finally led to a big payoff in the brutal and brilliant cable series Oz (1997). Christopher\u0027s introduction to the Oz prison as bisexual psychopath Chris Keller was powerhouse casting and he drew immediate notice and critical applause into the show\u0027s second season. Unflinching in its blood-soaked presentation of life behind bars, Chris\u0027 raw animal magnetism was unparalleled on the show and his steamy, erotic couplings with another male prisoner on screen promoted him swiftly to gay icon status. Undaunted by the possible career-damaging effects that could occur, Chris\u0027 frank acceptance and acknowledgment was admirable indeed and his outright support of human rights causes earned him high marks. The father of two (daughter Sophia Eva Pietra (born March 23, 2001), and son Dante Amadeo (born January 2, 2004), he has been married since 1995 to production designer \u0027Sherman Williams\u0027 (The Dark Backward (1991)). Chris\u0027 sudden burst of cable notoriety earned him his own prime time NBC series. With the veteran \"Law \u0026 Order\" program developing a sister spin-off, Law \u0026 Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), Meloni raised the bar with his trenchant pairing with co-star Mariska Hargitay as partners of a special victims crime unit. Despite the show\u0027s reality-driven approach, Meloni and Hargitay\u0027s dynamite chemistry carried the show to a new level. Allowing their characters\u0027 more serious flaws to surface, Meloni, in particular, managed to convey Detective Stabler\u0027s private pain and personal turmoil with a raw poignancy. Both he and Hargitay have been honored with Emmy award nominations for their work here (she has won). Occasionally appearing on stage, Chris\u0027 theater credits include \"The Rainmaker\" (as Starbuck) (1998) and \"Comers\" (1998), both at the Williamstown Theatre Festival. He earned standout reviews as Eddie Carbone in Arthur Miller\u0027s \"A View from the Bridge,\" which he performed at Dublin\u0027s Gate Theatre in 2005. In 2006 he joined the campy proceedings at an Actors\u0027 Fund of America Benefit of the soap opera spoof \"Die, Mommie Die!\" starring drag illusionist and \"Oz\" alumnus Charles Busch. Going well over a decade\u0027s worth of service to the series that made him a household name, Meloni finally retired his TV detective in 2011. Throughout the show\u0027s run he continued to flaunt his humorous side, showing up on such parody shows as \"Mad TV\" and cracking up on the various night time TV haunts. On film he continues to shatter his dramatic image in such fare as The Souler Opposite (1998), Wet Hot American Summer (2001), Harold \u0026 Kumar Go to White Castle (2004) and its sequel Harold \u0026 Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay (2008). While he has not found outright stardom on the big screen (he has nominally played \"other man\" roles in such popular films as Runaway Bride (1999) and Nights in Rodanthe (2008)), Chris has more than proved his staying power since he left the popular series. More recently he moved forward as a writer/producer/director/star of the comedy film Dirty Movie (2011), which also has in its cast \"L\u0026O: SVU\" co-star Diane Neal. In addition, Chris supplied the voice of DC Comics classic character Hal Jordan (aka Green Lantern) in the animated movie Green Lantern: First Flight (2009). He also has held regular roles on the series True Blood (2008) in 2012 and Surviving Jack (2014) as well as strong cinematic parts in the Superman film Man of Steel (2013) and in Small Time (2014).",

    "miniBio": "The legendary gangsta hip-hop emcee Ice-T was born Tracy Marrow on February 16, 1958, in Newark, New Jersey. He moved to Los Angeles, California, to live with his paternal aunt after the death of his father while he was in the sixth grade; his mother had died earlier when he was in the third grade. His aunt lived in the South Los Angeles district of Crenshaw, colloquially referred to as South Central. He became immersed in the street life of the inner-city and eventually became a member of the West Side Rollin 30s Original Harlem Crips. In 1979, Marrow joined the Army after leaving Crenshaw High School, but his 4-year hitch was enough for him, as he was a leader, not a follower. \"I didn\u0027t like total submission to a leader other than myself,\" he said. After ETSing from the Army in 1983, he returned to South Central with the intention of becoming a hip-hop musician. More than music, his life got caught up in street life as as a jewel thief and as a pimp. (His nomme de guerre, Ice T, is an homage to the fabled pimp and raconteur Iceberg Slim (Robert Beck). He committed himself totally to his music after a 1985 car crash. As a musician, Ice-T played a major role in the creation of the gangsta incarnation of hip-hop music and was a colossus of the West Coast hip-hop scene, despite his East Coast, greater New York, origins. Though his music displays a political consciousness, like the indictments of racism that were a hallmark of seminal hip-hop group Public Enemy, it also is nihilistic as befits a chronicler of street life. His most infamous song, the heavy metal \"Cop Killer,\" was one of the major battle in the cultural wars of the 1990s, in which cultural conservatives enlisted the Moses of the right wing, Charlton Heston, to get Ice-T dropped from his then-label, Sire/Warner Bros. The charismatic Ice-T has also achieved success as an actor in movies and on TV. He plays Detective Odafin Tutuola on the TV series Law \u0026 Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), which is ironic for someone famous for \"Cop Killer\" and his feud with the L.A.P.D. Ice-T currently resides in North Bergen, New Jersey, with his wife, Coco Austin.",

    "miniBio": "One actor who has deserved much acknowledgment and fame and has had to do without it on a number of occasions is Robert Sean Leonard, known by most as Dr. James Wilson on House M.D. (2004). But his career has spanned a number of classic films, alongside such greats as Daniel Day-Lewis, Christian Bale, Paul Newman, and Denzel Washington. Born Robert Lawrence Leonard in Westland, New Jersey, he attended first Fordham University and then Columbia University. Afterwards he was accepted into the Screen Actor\u0027s Guild, changing his middle name to \u0027Sean\u0027. Leonard\u0027s first acting role was My Two Loves (1986) where he was cast in a small role. That same year he was also in The Manhattan Project (1986). The film is a suspense thriller starring John Lithgow and is about a science experiment taken too far. Leonard continued on from these firsts and landed a role in Bluffing It (1987) and then acted in another teen comedy: My Best Friend Is a Vampire (1987). His next role is easily one of his most memorable. He took the second billing in Dead Poets Society (1989) opposite Robin Williams and Ethan Hawke. His character of Neil Perry is a young student whose passion for acting is smothered in fear of his father\u0027s wrath and his parents\u0027 domination of his life. While Robin Williams earned himself an Oscar nomination, Leonard gave a truly Oscar-worthy performance. The 20-year old actor was well on his way now, and he proceeded to act in another Oscar-nominated film: Mr. \u0026 Mrs. Bridge (1990) starring Paul Newman. Leonard resumed the rebellious youth act from \"Dead Poets\" as he played one of the children caught between their father\u0027s conservative ways and their own ideas. Leonard followed up with the not-so successful Married to It (1991). Two years after that Leonard found massive success in three different films. Firstly, he acted in Kenneth Branagh\u0027s Much Ado About Nothing (1993). Pulling in 60 million on an 8 million dollar budget, it remains one of the most successful films based off of a play by Shakespeare. Leonard was surrounded by other talents apart in addition to Branagh, such as Brian Blessed, Kate Beckinsale, Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton, and Emma Thompson. Leonard played the character of Claudio and was sadly criticized by several critics for his acting. However others such as Roger Ebert defended the young lead whose character is deceived into thinking his betrothed is unfaithful. In the same year, Leonard took the lead in Swing Kids (1993), which also starred Christian Bale, Frank Whaley, Barbara Hershey and Kenneth Branagh who, rather than upstage Leonard, Bale and Whaley, refused any credit in the film. The film, another success for Leonard, told the story of a group of friends in the Hitler Youth attempting to hold onto something they love-- the Lindy hop. Reviews were mixed, but the film has a faithful following to this day. Also that year Leonard took a smaller role in Martin Scorsese\u0027s elaborate and artistic film The Age of Innocence (1993) starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, and Michelle Pfeiffer. The film is about the aristocrat who must choose between two women and risk scandal. The film earned Ryder an Oscar nomination and a win for Best Costume. Leonard himself played the young son of Danny Archer and plays a crucial role at the end of the film. After these three great films Leonard\u0027s career slowed down. Despite acting in three different films in 1996 (the Oliver Stone-produced Killer: A Journal of Murder (1995) starring James Woods, the light-hearted The Boys Next Door (1996), and the romantic Viver Sem Medo (1996)) none were as successful as those he made in 1993. Leonard moved onwards to act in (among other things) The Last Days of Disco (1998) and the thriller Ground Control (1998) opposite Kiefer Sutherland, Henry Winkler, and Bruce McGill. Leonard\u0027s work changed as the new millennium began. He turned to television as well as continuing film. He acted in the series Limites do Terror (1995) and Wasteland (1999) as well as making movies such as the dramatic film Tape (2001) by Richard Linklater, A Glimpse of Hell (2001) opposite James Caan, and the box office bomb Driven (2001) starring Sylvester Stallone and Burt Reynolds. After a few more films Leonard was cast in the series that gave him much fame. House M.D. (2004) is a drama series about a cynical, antisocial, crippled doctor who is almost always correct in his solutions to medical problems. Leonard, the first actor to be cast in the series, plays the character of Dr. Wilson, the only person that House considers a friend. Wilson is a much more humane person than House, which leads to many debates between himself and House, though he is plagued by his own problems. It is the best known face that Leonard has ever portrayed in his career, and hopefully he will take on other fantastic roles and obtain the honors he so richly deserves.",

He attended Paisley Grammar school and while there he wrote about how he wanted to become a professional actor and play the role of the Doctor in \"Doctor Who.\" He made his first television appearance (which was also his first professional acting job) when he was 16, after his father sent some photos of him to a casting director at Scottish television. He also attended a youth theatre group at weekends run by the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (RSAMD - now renamed the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland [RCS]). When he was 16 he auditioned for and won a place at the RSAMD; the youngest student to ever do so, and started as a full time drama student when he was 17. He worked regularly in theatre and TV after leaving drama school, and his first big break came in 1994 when he was cast in a lead role in the Scottish drama \"Takin\u0027 Over the Asylum.\" He then moved to London where his career thrived. Amongst other things, he spent several years as a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, and became famous from his lead roles in TV dramas \"Blackpool\" and \"Casanova.\" In 2005, his childhood wish came true. David was cast to play the role of the Doctor in the BBC\u0027S new series of \"Doctor Who\" alongside Billie Piper, after Christopher Eccleston decided to leave.

Her paternal grandfather was French, and her other roots include English, German, Scottish, Irish, and Dutch. Driven from an early age to become a successful actress, Zooey got her big break, at age 17, playing a model in the TV sitcom, Veronica\u0027s Closet (1997). She got her first film role, the following year, in Mumford (1999), which prompted her to quit university to pursue acting full-time. Mostly thanks to a role in Cameron Crowe\u0027s popular biopic, Almost Famous (2000), Zooey\u0027s rise to fame has been steadily increasing as the 21st century wears on. Her distinctive acting style found her critical acclaim in 2003, when she was voted Best Actress at the Mar Del Plata Film Festival for her role in David Gordon Green\u0027s All the Real Girls (2003). She also gained a Best Female Lead nomination (for All the Real Girls (2003)) at the following year\u0027s Independent Spirit Awards, but lost out to Charlize Theron. Zooey has appeared in such films as (500) Days of Summer (2009), Our Idiot Brother (2011), Yes Man (2008) (opposite Jim Carrey), Elf (2003) (opposite Will Farrell), Your Highness (2011), The Happening (2008) (opposite Mark Wahlberg), The Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy (2005) and is the star of the FOX sitcom, New Girl (2011). Zooey is often compared to golden era Hollywood starlets and is also a talented singer. She has said in interviews that she believes her singing ability was pivotal in gaining the role of \"Jovie\" in Elf (2003).

    "miniBio": "James Patrick Caviezel was born on September 26, 1968 in Mount Vernon, Washington. He was one of five children born to Margaret (Lavery), a former stage actress, and James Caviezel, a chiropractor. The Caviezels are a closely knit Catholic family. He is of Irish (mother) and Swiss and Slovak-Romansh (father) descent; the surname, \"Caviezel\", is Romansh. As a youngster, Jim was described as being \"very intense.\" His two main interests growing up were sports and religion. He was athletically gifted on the basketball court and dreamed of someday playing in the N.B.A. He was also instilled with Christianity at a very young age, attending Church regularly with his family. In 1984, he went to Mount Vernon High School but transferred to O\u0027Dea High School after two years. The following spring, he transferred again to Burien Kennedy High School in Burien, Washington where he was a star on the basketball team and graduated in 1987. While at O\u0027Dea and Kennedy, he stayed with family friends. Following high school Jim enrolled at Bellevue Community College where he again played on the basketball team. A foot injury in his sophomore season put an end to Jim\u0027s basketball career and his dreams of playing in the N.B.A. Shortly after this, he turned his focus toward acting. In 1990, he auditioned for a part in the independent film My Own Private Idaho (1991). He won a very small role as a foreign airline clerk after he told casting agents that he was a recent Italian immigrant. The following year, Jim moved to Los Angeles where he worked as a waiter between auditions. He landed small roles in Diggstown (1992) and Wyatt Earp (1994) and guest starring roles on The Wonder Years (1988) and Murder, She Wrote (1984). He continued to go relatively unnoticed in small roles and even thought about quitting acting until 1998 when he received critical recognition for his role as idealist Private Witt in The Thin Red Line (1998). The following year, he gained further recognition with roles in Ride with the Devil (1999) and Frequency (2000). In 2001, his role as Jennifer Lopez\u0027s love interest in Olhos de Anjo (2001) helped to establish him as a versatile actor and leading man. It wasn\u0027t until 2002 that Jim made his strong religious beliefs known. While filming High Crimes (2002), he refused to do any love scenes with on-screen wife Ashley Judd because it conflicted with his strong Catholic faith. It was also around this time when he was chosen by Mel Gibson to star as Jesus Christ in The Passion of the Christ (2004). The movie made headlines and broke box-office records around the world, becoming one of the highest grossing films of all time. Although the movie dealt with controversial matters, Caviezel\u0027s performance was acclaimed by both critics and viewers. Jim\u0027s next big role would be on the small screen. In 2011, he landed the lead role in the CBS crime drama Person of Interest (2011). The show instantly clicked with audiences, becoming one of the highest rated shows on television. From an outcast actor to a respected film star to a television star, James Caviezel is continuing to give his best to play challenging roles. Off screen, Jim lives with his wife, Kerri, a school teacher whom he met on a blind date in 1993 and married in 1996, and their adopted children.",

Her mother is Italian American and Roman Catholic while her father is of Turkish Sephardi Jewish ancestry, and Lea was raised Catholic. Even though she was born in New York, Lea was raised in Tenafly, New Jersey where she eventually attended and graduated from Tenafly High School. At the age of eight years old, Lea went with a friend to an open casting call for an up-and-coming musical. After spontaneously deciding to audition, she was offered the role and, two weeks later, she was starring on Broadway. Lea debuted on Broadway in 1995 as a replacement for the role of \"Young Cosette\" in the original New York production of \"Les Misérables\". Following her theatrical debut in \"Les Misérables\", Lea was cast in the role of Tateh\u0027s daughter, \"the Little Girl\", in the 1998 original Broadway cast of \"Ragtime\" and, in 2004, Lea portrayed \"Shprintze\" and \"Chava\" in the Broadway revival of the musical \"Fiddler on the Roof\". When she was fourteen-years-old, Lea was given the role of \"Wendla\" in Steven Sater and Duncan Sheik\u0027s musical version of \"Spring Awakening\", starring in early workshops to off-Broadway and, finally, originating the role in the Broadway production at the age of twenty. Around the same time that the show was set to go to Broadway, Lea was offered the role of \"Eponine\" in the Broadway revival of \"Les Misérables\". However, she chose to remain with \"Spring Awakening\", which debuted on Broadway in December 2006. Lea was later nominated for a Drama Desk Award for her performance in \"Spring Awakening\" in the category of Outstanding Actress in a Musical. After two years of starring in \"Spring Awakening\", Lea left the show with co-star and good friend, Jonathan Groff, to pursue more performing opportunities. In early 2009, Lea won the role of \"Rachel Berry\" on the FOX television smash hit, Glee (2009), and since the show\u0027s premiere on May 19, 2009, Lea has since received worldwide critical and public acclaim for her performance on the show. She received the 2009 Satellite Award for Best Actress in a Series, Comedy or Musical and later won a Screen Actors Guild Award, as well. Along with her award wins, Lea has also received Golden Globe, Emmy, and Teen Choice Award nominations. It has quickly been established by this young woman\u0027s impressive and gifted talent, as well as her natural poise and grace, that this is only the beginning of a beautiful and successful career.",

    "miniBio": "An intelligent, highly-capable actor, Sam Trammell made inroads on the New York stage while building an intriguing career in mostly independent features. He attended Brown University where he gravitated to acting in his senior year. Trammell made his film debut as an intern at a tabloid TV talk show in the little-seen The Hotel Manor Inn (1997) and kept busy with auditioned and day-player roles on daytime serials. He made his primetime debut with a featured role in the 1996 CBS/Hallmark Hall of Fame presentation Harvest of Fire (1996) and won some attention as a man who has an affair with the mother of a friend in Childhood\u0027s End (1996). Returning to NYC, Trammell garnered attention and good reviews for a trio of stage performances. He was a compulsive gambler in his off-Broadway debut \"Dealer\u0027s Choice\", a gay man in \"My Night With Reg\" and earned a Tony nomination as the authorial stand-in in the Broadway revival of Eugene O\u0027Neill\u0027s comedy \"Ah, Wilderness!\" in 1998. Within months of capturing NYC audiences, the actor reached a wider constituency as the fast-talking ex-con \"Sonny Dupree\" in the quirky ABC comedy-drama Maximum Bob (1998). Later that year, Trammell was briefly seen as the youngest son in a large Irish-Catholic family in Trinity (1998) (NBC). Trammell returned to the stage in 1999, playing the troubled offspring of an award-winning TV actress (essayed by Elizabeth Ashley) in the unsuccessful drama, \"If Memory Serves\". 2000, though, proved a better year as the actor had a supporting role as a male hustler in the Sundance-screened Beat (2000), saw the release of Followers (2000), an affecting drama in which he played a would-be pledge to a fraternity who makes several decisions with tragic repercussions, and portrayed twins in the dramatic road movie Fear of Fiction (2000). Trammell rounded out the year garnering rave reviews for his turn as the title character\u0027s male lover in the off-Broadway play \"Kit Marlowe\", about the Elizabethan playwright.",

    "miniBio": "He was born Donald Edmond Wahlberg, Jr. on August 17, 1969, in Dorchester Massachusetts, into a family of Swedish, Irish, French-Canadian, and English descent. He is the eighth of nine children of Donald Sr. and Alma Wahlberg. His parents eventually divorced and Donnie, finding himself already in trouble, found a positive outlet performing in school plays and became involved in varied aspects of theater -- acting, writing, and directing. At the age of 15, he became a member of the teen vocal group originally called \"NYNUK.\" Donnie\u0027s younger brother, Mark Wahlberg, was originally one of the Boys but balked at the direction the group was taking and backed out. Following a false start with their debut album \"New Kids on the Block,\" the teens persevered with a sophomore record and proceeded to hit #1 with the single \"Please Don\u0027t Go Girl\" in 1988. They continued to bombard the market with one-after-another \"Top Ten\" hits including \"The Right Stuff\" and \"I\u0027ll Be Loving You Forever.\" Leaving the young girls panting for more, they became one of the hottest young singing/line-dancing groups to hit the late 80s/early 90s. The Boys went on to sell over 70 million albums worldwide, and provoke the spawning of other five-member harmony groups such as Backstreet Boys and *NSYNC. During its heyday, Donnie played up his resident \"bad boy\" persona by tallying up several run-ins with the law, including an alleged arson at a Kentucky hotel (charges were dropped). He also delved into \"body art\" with numerous tattoos and body piercings in an effort to buck their already-cloying image. Amid intergroup dissension and Milli Vanilli-like charges of not contributing all the vocals to their albums, the pop band finally disbanded in 1994 -- partly out of frustration but also having outgrown the group\u0027s juvenile moniker. Unsure of his direction while attracting more trouble in the tabloids, Donnie, who helped write, arrange and produce brother Mark\u0027s Funky Bunch group\u0027s first two albums a few years earlier, switched gears. He rapped some and modeled some, then transformed himself into an actor, a route taken earlier by his talented bro. While Mark has turned out to become the bigger film star over the years, Donnie has stepped out of his shadows to receive raves and renewed respect for his own tense and compelling character work. He first showed up in big screen action. Making his debut as a \"tough guy\" thug in the Mickey Rourke urban outing Bullet (1996), filmed in 1994 but not released until two years later. Usually cast as an amoral heavy, Donnie moved up the quality ladder with director Ron Howard\u0027s thriller Ransom (1996) as part of a gang of kidnappers who nab Mel Gibson\u0027s son, to their eventual regret, of course. His next repellent took the form of a drug dealer in the goth indie horror Black Circle Boys (1997), but the film came and went. After a couple of TV movies, he finally nabbed a starring role in the film Southie (1998) playing more or less himself as an Irish-American prodigal son who returns to the mean streets of his native Boston. The movie also featured another brother Robert Wahlberg who also was testing the acting waters. Ironically, one of Donnie\u0027s most powerful roles during this period was also one of his briefest. Seen in the opening sequence, he is nearly unrecognizable (having dropped an alarming amount of weight) portraying a deranged former patient of psychiatrist Bruce Willis whose sudden explosion into unfathomable violence sets up the clever twists and turns that turned M. Night Shyamalan\u0027s classic psychological thriller The Sixth Sense (1999) into a critically-acclaimed box office hit. Donnie\u0027s opening bit was mouth dropping and jarring in its horror. He also proved he wasn\u0027t a flash in the pan by backing up this performance with a major role as a WWII paratrooper in the critically-hailed ten-part epic Band of Brothers (2001), which won multiple Emmy awards (6). This TV role directly led to his casting as a gritty L.A. detective in the NBC dramatic series Boomtown (2002), an acclaimed series that didn\u0027t survive a second season. Since then Donnie has patented his unrefined intensity into a number of other films such as Triggermen (2002) and Saw II (2005). He lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Kim Fey, and sons Xavier and Elijah. As a former teen heartthrob seemingly headed down a troubled and dangerous path after his initial success, he somehow managed to avoid the traditional pitfalls of drugs and self-destruction, and has since proven himself an actor with \"the right stuff.\"",

    "miniBio": "David William Duchovny was born on August 7, 1960, in New York City, New York, USA. His father, Amram Duchovny, was a writer and publicist who was from a family of Jewish immigrants (from Ukraine and Poland), and worked for the American Jewish Committee. His mother, Margaret (Miller), was a Scottish-born school teacher. David has a sister, Laurie, and an older brother, Daniel Ducovny, an award-winning director of commercials, as well as a director of photography. David earned an undergraduate degree from Princeton University, and also attended Yale University, where he undertook a Master\u0027s Degree in English Literature. A keen poet and writer, David\u0027s work was well recognized by his peers and teachers while he was in attendance at Yale. He was even nominated for a college prize by the Academy of American Poets for his outstanding work within the literary field. While at Yale, he began commuting to New York to study acting and was soon appearing in off-Broadway plays. In 1987, he abandoned his doctoral studies at Yale to pursue acting full time. Like any actor or celebrity, David began his career on the bottom, by acting in numerous commercials in the late-eighties. He crossed over into films with bit parts in low key films such as New Year\u0027s Day (1989) and Bad Influence (1990). Although these parts were small and somewhat insignificant, it was a start and David was able to get his foot in the door. In 1991, David got offered the role of DEA Dennis Bryson on the acclaimed TV series, Twin Peaks (1990). He only appeared in three episodes, but at that early stage, it was his biggest claim to fame yet, as Twin Peaks (1990) was watched by millions of people worldwide. Needless to say, David\u0027s talents as an actor would finally be recognized and he would get the acknowledgment that he so richly deserved. In the early 1990s, he got more bit parts in films, this time, however, the films weren\u0027t \"low key\", but hits, such as Don\u0027t Tell Mom the Babysitter\u0027s Dead (1991) and the family favorite comedy, Beethoven (1992). David\u0027s role in Beethoven (1992) was small, but it was hard to forget the poor guy who was dragged across the lawn by the giant St. Bernard! A year later, in 1993, David got the lead role in the independent film Kalifornia (1993). The film also starred another up-and-coming young actor, Brad Pitt. In Kalifornia (1993), David played a journalist who goes on a cross-country tour of famous murder sites with his girlfriend as research for a book he is writing about serial killers. He takes Pitt\u0027s character along to help pay the bills, unaware that Pitt\u0027s character is in fact a serial killer himself. Although it did not do much business at the box office, it is still a great film and has become somewhat of a cult favorite among fans. That same year, David was offered the role of FBI Agent Fox \"Spooky\" Mulder on the long-running TV series The X-Files (1993). The show was a tremendous international success and propelled David (and his co-star Gillian Anderson) into super-stardom. His character of Mulder has become somewhat of a pop culture legend and is renowned the world over for his satirical wit and dry sense of humor. Fans loved the fact that he could keep a straight face and still crack and joke in the face of extreme danger. David improvised a lot of his own lines of dialogue while on the show and even penned and directed a few episodes. The series ended in 2002 and still has a strong, dedicated following. To date, David has reprised his role of Fox Mulder in two \"X Files\" feature films: The X Files (1998) and The X Files: I Want to Believe (2008). During the initial run of The X-Files (1993), David kept busy and made several films, such as: Return to Me (2000), alongside actress Minnie Driver and the comedy favorite Evolution (2001), with Julianne Moore, Seann William Scott and Orlando Jones. He even had a hysterical cameo as a self-obsessed, simple-minded hand model in the comedy-smash Zoolander (2001). In 2007, after a few years out of the limelight, David struck gold again after landing the plum role of Hank Moody in Californication (2007). The raunchy series follows the life of womanizing writer Hank Moody (Duchovny) as he tries to juggle his career and his relationship with his daughter and his ex-girlfriend. The show has become a hit for its off-the-wall humor and Duchovny\u0027s ability to always turn in a brilliant performance. It may have taken a while, but David has worked his way to the top and notched up an impressive resume along the way. We can expect to see a lot more of him in the future.",

Apparently Graham didn\u0027t even audition for the role as Tommy--he accompanied a friend to an audition for Ritchie one day and was asked if he was next. When Graham replied \"No,\" Ritchie told the then-unknown actor, \"I like your face,\" and was asked if he could start work Monday. So much is to be said of this actor, who started his career with bit parts on ITV (he played Lee Sankey on Coronation Street (1960) in 1999, and smaller films like Pit Fighter (2005). Graham has also appeared in the critically acclaimed Gangs of New York (2002), directed by Martin Scorsese, and has been on television, playing Sgt.

Born in Hawaii, Timothy was raised in Modesto California. He is the son of Katherine Lyon (Gideon) and John Vernon Bevan Olyphant, a college teacher. He has an older brother, Andy, who is in A\u0026R for Warner Brother Records, and a younger brother, Matt Olyphant, who was the lead singer for the punk rock group, Fetish, and is also an artist. His ancestry includes Russian Jewish (from a maternal great-grandfather), English, German, Scottish, Dutch, and Irish. Timothy quickly became Modesto, California\u0027s favorite son, competing as a pro swimmer and excelling at drawing. It was, by chance, that he enrolled in an acting course as an elective and decided to pursue an acting career. He took his family and headed to New York City, where he studied the craft and began auditioning for roles. From the beginning, he tried to choose diversified roles and take chances with every genre and always approached everything he did with commitment, humor and grace. Timothy is married to his college sweetheart, Alexis Knief, and, together, they raise three children, one son and two daughters in California. He has managed to keep his personal life out of the tabloids. He obviously has his priorities straight, as this is no easy task in Hollywood. Highlights of Olyphant\u0027s career include his riveting portrayal of \"Sheriff Seth Bullock\" in HBO\u0027s hit drama, Deadwood (2004). He now personifies intensity as complex Kentucky Marshal, \"Raylan Givens\", in FX\u0027s Justified (2010). On the big screen, in this year\u0027s The Crazies (2010), he had the chance to infuse his character with doubts, fears and humaneness in an inhumane situation. Mr. Olyphant proved he could carry a major movie on his talent, alone. He recently appeared in I Am Number Four (2011), a Steven Spielberg sci-if thriller, in which Tim provided the adult mentorship, taking a back seat to the teen cast.",

He is of English, Scottish, and Irish descent. Seth attended and studied animation at the Rhode Island School of Design and, after he graduated, he was hired by Hanna-Barbera Productions (Now called Cartoon Network Studios) working as an animator and writer on the TV series Johnny Bravo (1997) and Cow and Chicken (1995). He also worked for Walt Disney Animation as a writer on the TV series Jungle Cubs (1996). He created The Life of Larry (1995) which was originally supposed to be used as an in-between on MADtv (1995). Unfortunately the deal fell through but, a few months later, executives at FOX called him into their offices and gave him $50,000 to create a pilot for what would eventually become Family Guy (1999). On September 11, 2001, he was scheduled to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 after being a keynote speaker at his alma-mater in Rhode Island. Due to a mix-up by his travel agent, he was told that his flight was scheduled to depart at 8:15am but it really departed at 7:45am and he had arrived at Boston Logan Airport a few minutes after boarding was stopped on his flight and he was told he would have to wait for the next flight. At 8:45am, one hour after the departure of American Airlines Flight 11, it was hijacked by terrorists and crashed into One World Trade Center (North Tower) in New York City killing all on-board. He was able to contact his parents within 20 minutes of Flight 11 striking the first tower to tell them he was okay. He said that he thanked his travel agent for screwing up the departure time or he would have been on board.",

    "miniBio": "Born to immigrants in Queens, New York, Lucy Liu has always tried to balance an interest in her cultural heritage with a desire to move beyond a strictly Asian-American experience. Lucy\u0027s mother, Cecilia, a biochemist, is from Beijing, and her father, Tom Liu, a civil engineer, is from Shanghai. Once relegated to \"ethnic\" parts, the energetic actress is finally earning her stripes as an across-the-board leading lady. Liu graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1986 and enrolled in New York University; discouraged by the \"dark and sarcastic\" atmosphere of NYU, however, she transferred to the University of Michigan after her freshman year. She graduated from UM with a degree in Chinese Language and Culture, managing to squeeze in some additional training in dance, voice, fine arts, and acting. During her senior year, Liu auditioned for a small part in a production of Alice in Wonderland and walked away with the lead; encouraged by the experience, she decided to take the plunge into professional acting. She moved to Los Angeles and split her time between auditions and food service day jobs, eventually scoring a guest appearance as a waitress on Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990). That performance led to more walk-on parts in shows like NYPD Blue (1993), ER (1994), and The X-Files (1993). In 1996, she was cast as an ambitious college student on Rhea Perlman\u0027s ephemeral sitcom Pearl (1996). Liu first appeared on the big screen as an ex-girlfriend in Jerry Maguire (1996) (she had previously filmed a scene in the indie Bang (1995), but it was shelved for two years). She then waded through a series of supporting parts in small films before landing her big break on Ally McBeal (1997). Liu initially auditioned for the role of Nelle Porter, which went to Portia de Rossi, but writer-producer David E. Kelley was so impressed with her that he promised to write a part for her in an upcoming episode. The part turned out to be that of growling, ill-tempered lawyer Ling Woo, which Liu filled with such aplomb that she was signed on as a regular cast member. The \"Ally\" win gave Liu\u0027s film career a much-needed boost--in 1999, she was cast as a dominatrix in the Mel Gibson action flick Payback (1999), and as a hitchhiker in the ill-received boxing saga Play It to the Bone (1999). The next year brought even larger roles: first as the kidnapped Princess Pei Pei in Jackie Chan\u0027s western Shanghai Noon (2000), then as one-third of the comely crime-fighting trio in Charlie\u0027s Angels (2000). When she\u0027s not hissing at clients or throwing well-coiffed punches, Liu keeps busy with an eclectic mix of off-screen hobbies. She practices the martial art of Kali-Eskrima-Silat (knife-and-stick fighting), skis, rock climbs, rides horses, and plays the accordion. In 1993 she exhibited a collection of multimedia art pieces at the Cast Iron Gallery in SoHo (New York), after which she won a grant to study and create art in China. Her hectic schedule doesn\u0027t leave much time for romantic intrigue, but Liu says she prefers to keep that side of her life uncluttered.",

He and his family moved to County Cork, Ireland, when the actor was nearly a year old, and then, at the age of 3, his father left the family, leaving his mother to care for Jonny and his 3 younger brothers alone. Rhys Meyers grew up with a tumultuous childhood, spending some time in an orphanage and being permanently expelled from school at age 16. Happy to be out of school, he began spending time in a local pool hall where he was discovered by Hubbard Casting. The casting agents were talent-spotting for the David Puttnam production of War of the Buttons (1994), and asked Rhys Meyers to appear for an audition. After three days of auditions, however, he did not get the role, and Rhys Meyers gave up on his acting aspirations. Soon afterward, he received a call to audition for a national ad campaign for Knorr soup, and though embarrassed by the attention from the ad, he soon found himself considered for a major film. His movie acting debut was a very small role in the film Um Homem Sem Importância (1994), where his simple cast credit is as \"First Young Man\". His first lead role was in the film O Desaparecimento de Finbar (1996). During a 6-month postponement in production, he returned home to Cork and there received a call about the film Michael Collins (1996). He traveled to Dublin to meet with director Neil Jordan and successfully won the role of Collins\u0027s assassin. Jordan wrote about his meeting with the actor, \"I have found someone to play Collin\u0027s (sic) killer. Jonathan Rees-Myers (sic), from County Cork, apparently, who looks like a young Tom Cruise. [He] Comes into the casting session with alarming certainty. Obviously gifted\". Rhys Meyers continued working constantly from that point and appeared in such films as The Maker (1997), Telling Lies in America (1997), and The Tribe (1998). Going on to film The Governess (1998), B. Monkey (1998), Titus (1999) and Ride with the Devil (1999), he has received critical acclaim for several performances, most notably as \"Brian Slade\" in Velvet Goldmine (1998), as \"Steerpike\" in the British mini-series Gormenghast (2000), and as a sympathetic football coach in Bend It Like Beckham (2002). Rhys Meyers is also a talented singer and musician, having performed his own vocals in Velvet Goldmine (1998) and appearing on the film\u0027s soundtrack. Rhys Meyers still resides in County Cork, Ireland.",

    "miniBio": "Edith Falco, called Edie, was born on July 5, 1963, grew up on Long Island and attended SUNY Purchase, where she was trained in acting at the prestigious Conservatory of Theatre Arts and Film. She moved to Manhattan after graduation, auditioning for roles and supporting herself as best she could; for example, working parties for an entertainment company where she would wear a Cookie Monster costume and urge people to get on the dance floor. Falco began getting film roles, mostly smaller supporting parts, starting in the late 1980s. Her first notable role was a supporting part in Bullets Over Broadway (1994). Ironically, it was in television where the conservatory-trained Falco\u0027s career first flowered. She obtained her first recurring roles in 1993, on the acclaimed police dramas Homicide: Life on the Street (1993), as the wife of a blinded police officer, and Law \u0026 Order (1990) as a Legal Aid attorney. Next came a recurring role on the prison drama Oz (1997), as a sympathetic corrections officer. All the while she continued to work in film, still in small supporting roles. Supporting herself in acting continued to be a challenge until at last Falco found success in 1999, when she was cast in the HBO series The Sopranos (1999), as Carmela, the wife of New Jersey Mafia street boss Tony Soprano. \"The Sopranos\" gained her a great deal of visibility and praise for her exceptionally strong dramatic skills. In 2000 Falco became one of the few actresses in history to sweep all of the major television awards (the Emmy, the Golden Globe and the SAG Award) in one year for a dramatic role. She is also the first female actor ever to receive the Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Drama. Interestingly, her roles have frequently put her on one side of the law or the other--a defense attorney, a corrections officer, a cop\u0027s wife, a mobster\u0027s wife, a police officer (in a pilot for a television adaptation of the movie Fargo (1996)). She has also worked frequently on the stage, such as her award-winning work in the play \"Sideman,\" in \"The Vagina Monologues,\" and in revivals of \"Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune\" (which was hugely successful) and \"\u0027night Mother.\" Unlike her brashly assertive alter-ego Carmela Soprano, Falco is self-described as shy, but is clearly a witty and down-to-earth person. She sometimes travels with her beloved dog Marley, driving so that the dog does not have to travel in the baggage compartment. At one point Falco had a relationship with her \"Frankie and Johnny\" co-star Stanley Tucci. She was treated for breast cancer in 2004 and her prognosis is very good. In December 2004, Falco adopted a baby boy, whom she named Anderson, after her mother\u0027s surname. Another adoption, of a baby girl named Macy, followed in 2008.",

In 2005 Bruce appeared on the mini-series 24: Conspiracy (2005), the spin-off to the original Kiefer Sutherland series 24 (2001). The spin-off lasted for only a season, but the show landed him on the cover of Variety and Bruce continued making frequent television appearances across a steady length of series. Other series in which he has appeared include episodes in the 2005 season of Passions (1999), followed by work in 2006 on Joey (2004), the mob drama The Sopranos (1999), CSI: NY (2004), and Las Vegas (2003). Bruce scored a considerable level of notability by his portrayal of Dr. Chris Hughes on the daytime drama As the World Turns (1956). From 2007-2008, Dylan played this important character, making him the eighth actor to appear in this role, following the departure of actor Bailey Chase who played Hughes from January 2003-January 2005. In 2008, Bruce ended his time on the series and once more moved on to newer projects. He made his official film debut with the fast-paced action outing Unstoppable (2010), which stars veteran actor Denzel Washington and Chris Pine. Afterwards, Dylan had a recurring role on the series The Bay (2010) before landing work in the television movie thriller Willed to Kill (2012). In 2013, Dylan joined the cast of the drama series Orphan Black (2013).",

    "id": "nm0004790",
    "miniBio": "Scott Caan is the son of tough guy actor James Caan. While it is obvious that he admires tough method actors like Marlon Brando and Sean Penn, Scott also has a strong egalitarian streak, evidenced by his reasoning for baring his body in films. He is quoted as saying that originally only the women in the scene were to be nude, but that he felt it really sexist, so he stripped too. Scott was born on August 23, 1976 in Los Angeles, California. He spent his childhood being shuttled between his parent\u0027s homes. His mom is actress and model Sheila Ryan; the Caans divorced when Scott was a year old. He has an older half-sister, Tara, and three younger half-brothers: Alexander, Jacob, and James. His paternal grandparents were German Jewish immigrants. Self-desribed as a bad kid who was always getting into trouble, Scott initially steered clear of acting, opting to play sports instead. Scott benefited from his father\u0027s hands-on approach to child rearing; the elder Caan reportedly took a five-year hiatus to coach all of his son\u0027s little league teams. He also pursued his love of hip-hop by forming a group with his friend The Alchemist; as The Whooliganz, the duo made inroads on the music scene and signed an ill-fated contract with Tommy Boy Records. It did not take long for Scott to appear in front of the camera; in 1995, he took roles in a couple independent films, Star Struck (1995) and A Boy Called Hate (1995). Critical of his performances, Scott enrolled at Playhouse West in Los Angeles to study acting. Roles in more indies followed, including Bongwater (1997) and Gregg Araki\u0027s Nowhere (1997). His first major film was also a hit; he had a supporting role in Enemy of the State (1998) for director Tony Scott. He then appeared (in the buff) in Varsity Blues (1999) as a wisecracking receiver. By now, Scott had built a reliable reputation for playing strong-minded characters with a sense of humor, exemplified by his work in movies such a Boiler Room (2000), Ready to Rumble (2000), and his second hit picture, Gone in Sixty Seconds (2000). Scott\u0027s star rose with a fun supporting turn in Steven Soderbergh\u0027s Ocean\u0027s Eleven (2001) remake. At this time he had more indie turns in the films American Outlaws (2001), Novocaine (2001), and Sonny (2002) - Nicolas Cage\u0027s directorial debut starring James Franco. Scott followed up with his own directorial outing, Dallas 362 (2003). Scott reprised his role as Turk Malloy in Ocean\u0027s Twelve (2004), then took a supporting roles in two very different pictures: the sexy, ocean-bound thriller Into the Blue (2005) and in Nicole Holofcener\u0027s indie comedy, Friends with Money (2006). 2006 marked Caan\u0027s return to the director¹s chair, with The Dog Problem (2006), and soon was back for Ocean\u0027s Thirteen (2007). Over the past few years, Scott made memorable appearances as a recurring character on Entourage (2004). He has a starring role in the remake of the TV series Hawaii Five-0 (2010). Scott has also established himself as a photographer, having been mentored in the medium by cinematographer Phil Parmet. In 2009, he published his book, Scott Caan Photographs, Vol. 1.",

    "id": "nm0196654",
    "miniBio": "Through the diversity of his roles on stage and screen, Daniel Dae Kim continues to expand our perceptions of the Asian-American man. In characters ranging from the King of Siam, a Shakespearean hero, a social worker for the Chicago needy, to a counter-terrorist agent, his work has consistently proven to transcend the historical barriers of race and stereotype. Daniel\u0027s most recent work on ABC\u0027s Lost (2004), is no exception. As \"Jin Soo Kwon\", a Korean businessman and reluctant enforcer for his father-in-law, his character transformed from an overprotective \"traditional\" husband to a man who re-learns how to live and love. His portrayal of this multi-faceted character signaled a breakthrough for primetime network television, and has helped make Lost (2004) a worldwide hit since its debut in 2004. Since then, both Daniel and the show have been widely recognized for their excellence. Sharing a 2006 Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble, the Korean-American actor\u0027s universal appeal was also recognized by \"People\" Magazine, which named him one of the \"Sexiest Men Alive\" in 2005, as well as \"TV Guide\", which recognized him as one of \"TV\u0027s Sexiest Men\" in 2006. In that same year, Daniel was individually honored with an AZN Asian Excellence Award, a Multicultural Prism Award and a Vanguard Award from the Korean American Coalition, all for Outstanding Performance by an Actor. In 2009, his recognition continues with the prestigious KoreAm Journal Achievement Award in the field of Arts and Entertainment. Born in Busan, South Korea and raised in New York and Pennsylvania, Daniel discovered acting while a student at Haverford College. Though briefly considering a career as an attorney, he decided to follow his true passion and moved to New York City, where he began his work on stage. There, he performed in classics such as \"Romeo and Juliet\", Anton Chekhov\u0027s \"Ivanov\" and Henrik Ibsen\u0027s \"A Doll\u0027s House\", as well as working with an improv comedy troupe. Despite his early success, however, he decided to deepen his dedication to the craft by studying at the Graduate Acting program at New York University\u0027s Tisch School of the Arts, where he earned a Master\u0027s Degree in Fine Arts in 1996. Upon graduation, Daniel\u0027s film career began in earnest with roles in The Jackal (1997), For Love of the Game (1999), The Hulk (2003), Spider-Man 2 (2004) and The Cave (2005), as well as the Academy Award-winner for Best Picture, Colisão (2004). Most recently, he completed production on The Adjustment Bureau (2011), starring Matt Damon and directed by George Nolfi. On television, he\u0027s guest-starred on numerous shows, including CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000), ER (1994) and, for two seasons, 24 (2001) as CTU Agent \"Tom Baker\". In 2008, he also starred in the Emmy-nominated mini-series adaptation of Michael Crichton\u0027s The Andromeda Strain (2008). Kim has also complemented his television work by lending his voice talents to video games, creating characters in \"Saints Row\" 1 and 2, \"Scarface: The World Is Yours\", \"Tenchu\" and \"24\", as well as the animated TV series\u0027 Justice League (2001) Unlimited and Avatar: The Last Airbender (2005). This past summer, Daniel rekindled his love for the stage by performing the role of the \"King of Siam\" in the iconic production, \"The King and I\", directed by Jeremy Sams, at London\u0027s world-renowned Royal Albert Hall. Though he spends time in Los Angeles and New York, Daniel spends most of the year in Honolulu, where he devotes his free time to a number of different charities, his restaurant and his family.",

His mother, Betsy Franco, is Jewish, and his father, Douglas Eugene \"Doug\" Franco, was of Portuguese and Swedish descent, and ran a Silicon Valley business. James\u0027s mother, a writer, has occasionally acted. Growing up with his two younger brothers, Dave Franco, also an actor, and Tom, James graduated from Palo Alto High School in 1996 and went on to attend UCLA, majoring in English. To overcome his shyness, he got into acting while studying there, which, much to his parents\u0027 dismay, he left after only one year. After fifteen months of intensive study at Robert Carnegie\u0027s Playhouse West, James began actively pursuing his dream of finding work as an actor in Hollywood. In that short time, he landed himself a starring role on Freaks and Geeks (1999). The show, however, was not a hit to its viewers at the time, and was canceled after its first year. Now, it has become a cult-hit. Prior to joining Freaks and Geeks (1999), Franco starred in the TV miniseries To Serve and Protect (1999). After that, he had a starring role in Whatever It Takes (2000). Although he\u0027d been working steadily, it wasn\u0027t until the TNT made-for-television movie, James Dean (2001) that James rose to fan-magazine fame and got to show off his talent. Since then, he has been working non-stop. After losing the lead role to Tobey Maguire, James settled for the part of \"Harry Osborne\", Spider-Man\u0027s best friend in the summer 2002 major hit Spider-Man (2002). He returned to the Osborne role for the next two films in the trilogy. Next was Deuces Wild (2002) and City by the Sea (2002), in which Robert De Niro personally had him cast, after viewing his performance in James Dean (2001). He was recently seen in David Gordon Green\u0027s Pineapple Express (2008) opposite Seth Rogen, in George C. Wolfe\u0027s Nights in Rodanthe (2008), starring Richard Gere and Diane Lane and in Paul Haggis\u0027 In the Valley of Elah (2007), starring Tommy Lee Jones. Also starring opposite Sean Penn in Gus Van Sant\u0027s Milk (2008) in which his performance earned him an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actor.
